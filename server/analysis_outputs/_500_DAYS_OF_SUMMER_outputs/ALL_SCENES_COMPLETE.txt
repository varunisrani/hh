The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that. Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from “Jerry Maguire”. May 21st. Other Mother’s Day. The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of the department. Hmmm. That’s an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman’s “Magellan Day” I’d say we’ve got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these? Tom is about to answer when the door opens. Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There’s a call for you on line 3. And in walks this girl. Summer. We’ve met her by now but Tom hasn’t. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from that moment on, he can’t take them off her. (to the table) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from-- Michigan. Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this. 12. Nice to meet you all. Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out. She doesn’t notice Tom whose face looks like he’s just seen God. (3, 4, 5)

He met a girl. (excited) Yeah? (grim) Yeah. Sarah grows serious too. Oh shit. The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven’s Gate, Neil Armstrong. When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds. 18. LITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of Olivia Newton-John in “Xanadu.” Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of “true love.” (beat) The evidence did not support him. -8914

Because you’re, like, the biggest music nerd I’ve ever met, I think this should really help explain where I’m coming from. A pop song begins to play on the stereo. They listen for a few beats.

It’s just-- When I hear it now, I don’t feel the same- - rush. (still confused) Ok-- I press the skip button. Still Tom doesn’t understand. What does this have to do with--?

(singing) “Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!” They won’t let you back in there after last time. I wasn’t that bad. Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you. (reverential) 25. You saved my life that day. We are not going back there. This is a work thing, Tommy. It won’t be like that. The whole office is going. I really can’t. Even if I wanted to. There’s a lot of stuff I gotta take care of. You’re not listening to me. What? The whole office is going. Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on him.

Scene Name: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT5252
Scene Action: Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he’s singing “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” by Poison. He’s real into it and, well, it’s kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks over to the booth. Hi. Hey! They said you weren’t coming. You asked if I was coming? (beat) I mean, my plans got cancelled-- Tom is at a loss. There’s yet another awkward silent beat between them. Thankfully, it’s interrupted by -- (already drunk) Goddamn that song is brilliant! What’s up Hansen? 26. Summer sees the next song come up on the screen. Ooh that’s me. She downs a shot and jumps up on stage. (into mic) Ok. I’m the new girl so no making fun of me. Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep breath as the opening bars of “Born to Run” begin to play and Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it’s something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a midget in a tuxedo.) Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can’t help but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles, hopeful that she’ll come over. She doesn’t. He hides his disappointment. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is there in mid-conversation with McKenzie. You were great up there, by the way. Well you can’t go wrong with The Boss. (sitting down) I hear that. Hey, did you know Tom here’s from Jersey? Yeah? Lived there till I was 12. 27. I named my cat after Springsteen. No kidding? What’s his name? Bruce. (beat) That makes sense. She laughs. She’s really cute when she laughs. So you got a boyfriend? Me? No. Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie mouths “what?” Summer sees nothing. Why not? Don’t really want one. Come on. I don’t believe that. You don’t believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent? (beat) Are you a lesbian? No, I’m not a lesbian. I’m just not comfortable being somebody’s “girlfriend.” I don’t want to be anybody’s anything, you know? I have no idea what you’re talking about. 28. It sounds selfish, I know, but-- I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We’re young. We’re in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I say, let’s have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later. But, what if you meet someone and fall in love? (laughs) Love? You seriously believe in that stuff? Of course I do. Interesting. A real romantic. Oh you have no idea. This one-- embarrassing. There was this one girl, (to Tom) I gotta tell this story -- Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up. Summer, hold on, you don’t believe in love? I don’t even know what that word means. I know I’ve never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents. Well mine too but -- 29. Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in “love” with a rock. Is that the love you’re talking about? Well-- Why, what’s your take on it? AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN

Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous. (can’t help himself) Self-confidence! Ha! Tom elbows him in the ribs again. Anyway, I’m not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people. Ok then. Let’s drink. It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing. Bartender! Tom is up there singing The Clash’s “Magnificent Seven.” You wouldn’t think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He’s dancing like Jagger, he’s got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It’s a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming something. That’s not it. What is that then? I have no idea. They’re both having a good time. I used to watch it every week. 31. Me too. Why can’t we think of the stupid A-Team theme song. Pathetic. This is gonna bother me for weeks. Totally. They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good way. ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of “Proud to Be an American.” He really means it. At any minute he might start to cry. “And I’d proudly stand UP!” (aggressive drunk) I said stand!

(beat, to Summer) He likes you. (quickly) Ok, goodnight McKenzie! I mean-- likes you, likes you. For real. Tell her Tom. Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it’s just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase McKenzie’s last exchange from her mind. Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It’s unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don’t know. But at least he didn’t -- Is that true? What? You know what. Do you like me? Yeah. I like you. Of course I do. As a friend. Right. As a friend. Just as a friend? 33. The wheels are spinning in Tom’s head. What’s the right answer here? Yes. I mean-- I haven’t really thought about-- Yes. Why? Nothing. I just-- You’re interesting. I’d like us to be friends. Is that ok? Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He hides his disappointment the best he can. Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That’s-- perfect. Cool. Cool. Silence. Well, I’m that way. Good night Tom. G’night Summer. Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way. (under his breath) Friends. Awesome. That’s just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot. Tom walks a few more steps. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED HIM INTO A KISS! It’s unbelievable. There’s a few seconds where Tom isn’t sure if he’s dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening. (29) 34.

We can’t talk during this song. It’s too beautiful. And it is. Tom’s hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There’s something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl. 52. “In life I know there’s lots of grief/ but your love is my relief.” (172)

Complete Content: 51. Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face. They’re silent a Hi. Hi. Are you ok? Yeah. You sure? He’s not. He clenches his teeth. And begins-- Summer, I’ve gotta ask you something. Ok. Wait! Summer finds on the radio a particular song. (”Waiting in Vain” by Bob Marley, if you must know.) Whoa. Oh my god. We can’t talk during this song. It’s too beautiful. And it is. Tom’s hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There’s something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl. 52. “In life I know there’s lots of grief/ but your love is my relief.” (172)

Listen, about tonight-- I think I might just stay in and go to bed early. What? Why? 70. I’m just really tired and I’ve gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead? Well-- You don’t want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you’ve gotta eat right? I’m not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right? (touching his tie) Sorta. I’d rather not. Seriously, do you mind? Tom is standing still now, no longer moving. He’s trying to keep his frustration from being audible. Hey, no, that’s cool. Whatever you want to do. Thank you. So we’ll talk tomorrow, alright? Sure. Great. Good night Tom. Good night. (beat) Hey, Happy-- birthday. But the line is dead. Tom’s head sinks into his chest. Yet another frustrating night. CU PAUL, TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA DOCUMENTARY STYLE 71. I just got lucky I guess. We met in elementary school. We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just-- clicked. Love? Shit, I don’t know. As long as she’s cute and she’s willing, right? Actually, cute is a strong word. Not atrocious. That’s a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don’t they? “There is always some madness in love, but there is also-- always some reason in madness.” Think about it. Pretty smart. Although, Nietzsche also said “Kill the Jews.” So there’s that. I’ve been happily married for 30 years. She’s the light that guides me home. (beat) Yes it is from one of our cards. (beat) No someone else wrote it. Doesn’t make it less true. Ok I’m sick of this love shit. Come on! We’ve been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it’s now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a break! 72. I’m just saying-- I really need some ass. I’m desperate. (beat) You got nothing? I wouldn’t say “the girl of my dreams,” no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But, truth is Robyn’s better than the girl of my dreams. (beat) You know why? Cause she’s real. He says nothing. Just stands there. So confused. We go right ANIMATION. A QUICK 5 second recap of the earlier color sequence. (101)

And here they come, Tom’s mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin. Tom’s face registers a noticeable panic. Hey! Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah hugs and kisses her son. (looking at Summer) Hi Mom. Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok. Mom, Martin, this is Summer. Summer! Well hello! We’ve heard so much about you! It’s so good to finally meet you. Sarah hugs Summer. You too. And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices Summer’s face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he hugging me? (to Tom) Is this the girlfriend? Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do? Well this is the girl friend I’ve told you about. I don’t know if “girlfriend” is the right word-- You going to see the serial killer one? Yes we are. 76. Great! Should we save you seats? Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for Summer. Absolutely. Ok. We’ll see you inside. When they’re out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is distraught. Sorry about that. It’s fine. You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt. Did you tell them I was your girlfriend? What?! No way, I never used that word. They seemed to think-- I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug? He’s very-- loving. Does he hug all your friends? There’s that word again. Summer looks at Tom, like she’s disappointed or even angry at him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the theatre. He’s forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as ever. Why is none of this easy?

But I’ve accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn’t the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do.

A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. First we see, “Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl.” CO-WORKER This one says “Go for it!” She clicks to the next slide. “Cat Hanging From Tree Branch.” CO-WORKER 85. This one says “Don’t give up!” Click. We see “Cat Considering a Giant Leap.” CO-WORKER And this one says “You can do it!” We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you. She takes her seat. Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who’s next. We haven’t heard from “Sympathy” in a while. Hansen-- (reacting to his name) Hmm? The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute? Uh, no. I really don’t. You have nothing? Well I wouldn’t say nothing. Actually, that’s about right. (disappointed) Ok. We’ll come back to you. McKenzie -- You know what? Yes, Tom. Can I say something about the cat? Well sure. Go ahead. 86. This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect-- but this-- this is total shit. Tom! “Don’t give up?” “You can do it?” He points to the screen, still showing the “Cat About to Leap” image. This isn’t inspirational. It’s suicidal. He tries that jump, I’m writing a sympathy card for that cat. That’s the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It’s bad enough writing these things for people. Hansen, this is a place of business. We don’t cut down our co- workers -- That’s cause we’re liars! It’s what we do here. Why don’t we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense? CO-WORKER (RHODA) We’re a greeting card company. Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There’s paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can’t say how they feel. Or they’re afraid to. And we provide the service that lets ‘em get away with that! Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing uncomfortable. I say to hell with it! Let’s level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what’s this-- 87. (picks a card off the table) “I’m sorry to hear your grandmother has passed.” What the hell? Let’s give em some truth. Something like, “Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here’s a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I’m sure it makes up for the fact that grandma’s dead.” Vance and the card-writing team are appalled. Think about it. (picks up another card) “Congratulations on your new baby.” Eh-- How bout “Congratulations on your new baby. Guess that’s it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy.” Hansen, sit down! (picks up a card) Wait, what’s this? Ooh, fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let’s open it up. “Happy Valentine’s Day, Sweetheart. I love you.” Oh that’s nice. Tom-- If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance-- I would eat it. Tom! Tom recognizes he’s losing his shit. He takes a seat on the boardroom table. (beat) It’s these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They’re responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We’re responsible! 88. Everyone shifts in their seats. I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn’t do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it’s not love at all. Maybe there’s no such thing as love. Maybe it’s “galoogoo.” (beat) Yeah I made it up, so what?! Tom gets up and walks to the door. It’s all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can’t do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There’s enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit. And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It doesn’t really take.

Scene Action: Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything’s alright. It’s exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing. Hey. He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It’s unclear if she hugs back. Hey Sum, it’s just a movie. I know. I’m sorry Tom. Is everything alright with you? She smiles, tries to pull herself together. Yeah. I’m just, I’m sorry. I’m being ridiculous. 99. It’s ok. This happens to me every time I watch “Hoosiers.” Let’s go for a walk, ok. Let’s get some air. Or go to Sister Ray’s. Ok. They walk. INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT147147 Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles. He grabs one. It pains me that we live in a world where no one’s ever heard of Spearmint. I’ve never heard of them. And it’s painful. Oh look. He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as we’ve seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down the aisles. In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer’s hand. But something happens. It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if there’s something to read in that. (411)

Scene Name: EXT. PARK - DAY151151
Scene Action: Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there’s her voice. Hey. Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn’t sure if she’s real. He doesn’t quite know what to do. Where you coming from? What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there? Awhile. 103. Tom finds it hard to look at her. I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here. The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty. So-- I should probably say congratulations. Probably. But only if you mean it. I don’t know if I do honestly. I understand. Yeah well, anyway, I hope you’re happy. You really do? (beat) God no. They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate. How are you, Tom? I’m good. Ish. That’s good. Yeah I quit the office. Really? That’s great! What are you doing now? Mostly sleeping. Breaking things. 104. Awkward silence. So who’s the guy? Who, my guy? Yeah, wait. Don’t tell me. I don’t want to know. Tom-- No really, I don’t. Ok. More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And It’s amazing to me. You’re married. I know. You’re not only someone’s girlfriend, your someone’s wife! Pretty crazy, huh? (sighs) I’ll never understand that. Tom -- What’s different now? How could things change so quickly? I don’t know. It just happened. What happened?! That’s what I don’t get. 105. I-- Tom-- What, tell me-- I woke up one day and I knew. Tom says nothing. I knew I could promise him I’d feel the same way every morning. In a way that I-- I never could with you. And there’s not much else to say after that. Tom gets up to leave. You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit. What is? Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It’s nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn’t it? God! Tom, don’t go. I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along. Summer takes a beat to let this hang there. I was right? And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh. What? This is funny? Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now’s she’s completely cracking up. 106. What are you laughing at? And she can’t stop. She’s totally lost control. (trying himself not to laugh) You’re a crazy person! Tom! You’re the crazy person! What are you talking about?! One day I’m reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he’s my husband! This is funny to you? What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself “Holy shit. Tom was right.” You were right about all of it. (beat) It just wasn’t me you were right about. Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a few seconds more. And then, the hands separate. Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I’m glad you’re well. Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After 107. Summer! She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever. I really do hope you’re happy. I know. (beat) See you later. And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second.

SCENE 142:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY152152
Scene Action: Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is bigtime. Tom waits. We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back. Are you here to interview? Sorry? Are you interviewing? For the position? Oh. Yeah. Why, are you? Yup. 108. Ah. My competition. It would appear. Gee, this is a little awkward. Yes it is. Well, I hope you don’t get it. I hope you don’t get it. They both laugh. There’s a silence for a few beats. And it’s during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He’d like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he’s a little surprised by it. So, uh-- Hmm? Are you from, California? Grew up not too far from here. Atherton, near Stanford. I know Atherton. Nice area. Have I seen you before? I, uh, don’t know. I don't think so. Do you go to St. Patrick’s? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside? 109. I do! I love that church. It’s like my favorite structure in the city. If only it wasn’t near that horrible mirrored thing-- Yes! Exactly. I totally agree! Yeah. (beat) I think I’ve seen you there. You have? Really? Hmm. I didn’t see you. It happens. You probably weren’t looking. A MAN comes out. Tom Hansen? Yes. Come on back. Thank you. He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl. If Tom had learned anything, it was that you can’t ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That’s all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence. ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast. Hardly noticeable. But it’s there. 110. It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There’s no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew. He was sure of it now. (beat) Tom was-- Tom turns back around. --pretty sure. (to Girl) Excuse me. Hello stranger. When this is over-- uh-- would you like to maybe-- grab a cup of coffee or something? Oh. I’m sorta supposed to meet someone. (deflated) Oh. Got it-- No problem. He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears. Ok. Tom turns back around. What’s that? Why not? Yeah? Yeah. 111. Great! So, I’ll wait for you here, or you wait for me or something. She laughs. She’s cute when she laughs. We’ll figure it out. Ok! (extends hand to shake) My name’s Tom. Nice to meet you-- She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake. I’m Autumn. And on his face-- (1) CREDITS ROLL TO “GO ASK YOUR DAD” by THE TYDE.
