(CONTINUED) (blurts) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months? (startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip. That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him! Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and-- Who's expendable. It's just business. (angry) 8. I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month? (frank) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job. Lester stares at him, powerless.

As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door. CAROLYN (CONTâ€™D) So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- (heavy disdain) --"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months. 9. She heads into the house, followed by Lester. Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore. Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? (MORE) (CONTINUED) I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was.

TEENAGE GIRL #1 Gross. It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool. 28. TEENAGE GIRL #1 So, did you do it with him? Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down. TEENAGE GIRL #2 You are a total prostitute. Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick. TEENAGE GIRL #2 So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington. The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela. (calling off) Cunt! (then) I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me. The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. (CONTINUED) Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night. Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic. You know him? 29. Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution. Why? What did he do? What do you mean? Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile. You total slut. You've got a crush on him. What? Please. You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies. Shut up. Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her. Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you. (CONTINUED) I know.

Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT. (CONTINUED) You were masturbating. I was not. Yes, you were. He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up. All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off. Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) That's right. I was choking the bishop. Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my monster. That's disgusting. 46. Well, excuse me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins! So do I! Really? I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it. Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage. This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department. Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated? (CONTINUED) I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm ready. (furious) Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin! On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours. 47. She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers contentedly.

What is this? Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean. Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night. It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss. Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it. You like Pink Floyd? I like a lot of music. Man, I haven't listened to this album in years. He shakes his head, then puts the CD case down. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS. How much do you want? I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce? (CONTINUED) (indicates bag) Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred. Wow. (indicates another bag) 51. But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia. Is that what we smoked last night? This is all I ever smoke. How much? Two grand. Jesus. Things have changed since 1973. You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it. A beat. Thanks. (hands him a bag) There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash. (looks around room) Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track. (CONTINUED) That sucks. No actually, it was great. All I did was party and get laid. (smiles) 52. I had my whole life ahead of me... My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs.

Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn.

And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever. A beat. RICKY (CONTâ€™D) Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... Now Jane is watching him. RICKY (CONTâ€™D) (distant) Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in. After a moment, Jane takes his hand.

(overly cheerful) No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. (to Lester) Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey? Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin. Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus. Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of. And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink. (ashen) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job! (CONTINUED) 67. Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus. Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now-- I already have a job. (not stopping) No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job-- (overlapping) Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus? (Rises) Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this-- (means it) Sit down. Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) I'm sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist. You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it and I don't complain. All I want is the same courtesy-- (CONTINUED) 68. (overlapping) Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of-- Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane. (casual) Don't interrupt me, honey. He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened. Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage. Jane just stares at the plate in front of her. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music. Because frankly, and I don't think I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is. ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs. Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to SING.

Scene Name: INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER102102
Scene Action: Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to lived in. Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he looks up at her. What? Ah, whose car is that out front? Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I always wanted and now I have it. I rule! 74. Where's the Camry? I traded it in. Shouldn't you have consulted me first? Hmm, let me think... No. You never drove it. (then) (MORE) (CONTINUED) Have you done something different? You look great. (brusque) Where's Jane? Jane not home. We have the whole house to ourselves. He smiles at her playfully. She stares back, annoyed. It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just LAUGHS. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) Christ, Carolyn. When did you become so... joyless? (taken aback) Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy in my life. (leaning toward her) 75. Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I haven't. His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet... (barely audible) Lester. You're going to spill beer on the couch. She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His smile fades, and the moment is gone. So what? It's just a couch. (CONTINUED) This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not "just a couch." It's just a couch! He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) This isn't life. This is just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts. Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) (calls after her) I'm only trying to help you.

Scene Action: 76. glances at us. (shy) Don't. We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room. A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month since his father beat him up, and there are still slight SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane. Why? It's weird, watching myself. I don't like how I look. I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are. (CONTINUED) I'm not going to sit here for that shit. She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes. JANE (CONTâ€™D) Ha. How does it feel now? Fine. You don't feel naked? I am naked. You know what I mean. Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid. JANE (CONTâ€™D) 77. Tell me about being in the hospital. Ricky smiles. When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? (laughs) Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. (then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years. Wow. You must really hate him. (CONTINUED) He's not a bad man. He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it. Well... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me. (laughs) Wait. I do hate my father. Why? He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting. 78. You'd rather he had the crush on you? Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is. (then) I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's doing massive psychological damage to me. How? Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline. They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed. JANE (CONTâ€™D) I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (MORE) (CONTINUED) JANE (CONTâ€™D) (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. Her mind wanders for a beat. Want me to kill him for you? Jane looks at him and sits up. Yeah, would you? (smiles) It'll cost you. 79. Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job. She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, LAUGHING. JANE (CONTâ€™D) But my tits can wait, huh? You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad. Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I? She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. JANE (CONTâ€™D) (suddenly nervous) You know I'm not serious, right? Of course. He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. (CONTINUED) RICKY (CONTâ€™D) Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?

Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then... This is my first time. Lester LAUGHS. You're kidding. (a whisper) I'm sorry. A beat. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading. This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child. ANGELA (CONTâ€™D) I still want to do it... I just thought I should tell you... in case you wondered why I wasn't... better. 102. Lester's face falls. There's no way he's going to go through with this now. (CONTINUED) ANGELA (CONTâ€™D) (confused) What's wrong? I thought you said I was beautiful. (tenderly) You are beautiful. He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders, covering her nakedness. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) You are so beautiful... and I would be a very lucky man... He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to cry. I feel so stupid. Don't. He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently. I'm sorry. Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious. You have nothing to be sorry about. But she keeps crying. Lester hugs her again. We HEAR a loud CLAP of THUNDER outside. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) (smiles) It's okay. Everything's okay.

Thanks. How's Jane? What do you mean? I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it. 104. Angela shifts uncomfortably. She's... she's really happy. She thinks she's in love. Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is. (CONTINUED) (quietly) Good for her. An awkward beat. How are you? (smiles, taken aback) God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. (thinks about it) I'm great. (suddenly) I've gotta go to the bathroom. She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content. (laughs) I'm great. Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for... photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look. Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago... 105. LESTER (CONTâ€™D) Man oh man... (softly) Man oh man oh man... After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull. ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the WHITE TILE WALL. (CONTINUED) Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING unnaturally. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD, the same deep crimson as the roses.
