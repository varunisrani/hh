The jingle of carabiners. The hand clips a descender onto a loop on the harness. A Camelbak pouch of water, another water bottle. All drop in the rucksack. The hand gropes blindly around the high shelf. Looking for something else, something out of sight. We see a Swiss Army Knife at the back of the shelf. His hand skims past it a couple of times, millimeters away. Misses it. Clearly giving up on this, the hand picks up a coil of climbing rope, moves into another room. We move with the hand, not seeing the person, just his efficient intent.

The opening titles are a series of triptychs, three strips of pictures that merge, blend, overlap and are intercut with adverts from the tv and radio and some that flash past outside Aron’s Toyota. 4. “Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky- all that which lies beyond the end of the roads.” Edward Abbey. Desert Solitaire.

But I think we’re- - you’re- Seeing as I’m today’s designated map-reader, I’m...lost. Okay, well, no problem. You’re... here. He points to the map. We are? (pretending to be in control) Sure we are.

And as it’s Saturday... He takes the bandana off with a flourish. Shrugs as if that’s the best he can do with the materials available. I can’t take this one off. It’s my face. Kristi and Megan laugh. Aron laughs. Ice broken. He sticks out his hand, extremely formal. Aron. Kristi sticks hers out, equally formal. Kristi. Allow me to introduce you to my friend and companion, Megan. Pleasure to meet you, Mister Aron. An honor. And they shake too. And all laugh. So, you’re lost. And I’m a guide. He looks at them, expectantly. I’m good. The girls look at each other. Sure. Why not. Aron checks his watch. Puts his hand to it. C/U WATCH. Huge on the watch. With a click, the sweeping second hand comes to a stop.

But I think we’re- - you’re- Seeing as I’m today’s designated map-reader, I’m...lost. Okay, well, no problem. You’re... here. He points to the map. We are? (pretending to be in control) Sure we are. I knew that. Aron laughs. And the Long Wall is back up there. Oh. Easy to miss. No kidding. Err, hi, by the way. Hi. I’ll take you back up there if you like. The girls look at each other. Don’t know how to break it to him. Then he gets it. Oh, sorry. The Friday the 13th, Child-Killer look. He struggles with the bandana around his mouth. 11. I’m really only a psychopath on weekdays. And as it’s Saturday... He takes the bandana off with a flourish. Shrugs as if that’s the best he can do with the materials available. I can’t take this one off. It’s my face. Kristi and Megan laugh. Aron laughs. Ice broken. He sticks out his hand, extremely formal. Aron. Kristi sticks hers out, equally formal. Kristi. Allow me to introduce you to my friend and companion, Megan. Pleasure to meet you, Mister Aron. An honor. And they shake too. And all laugh. So, you’re lost. And I’m a guide. He looks at them, expectantly. I’m good. The girls look at each other. Sure. Why not. Aron checks his watch. Puts his hand to it. C/U WATCH. Huge on the watch. With a click, the sweeping second hand comes to a stop.

Scene Action: The three of them are standing in front of the petroglyphs and pictographs that are carved and painted onto the flat cliff side. Outside the shade of the cliff, the day is fierce, white, mottled heat. In contrast to the previous, breezy scenes, this all hazy, Picnic at Hanging Rock trippiness. They stand in the shade of the golden wall, moving silently from one shape to another. The images merge dreamily. The strange, warrior-like aliens, the wild sheep, the circles and spirals that nobody understands. You can hear their quiet breathing, echoing off the cool rock. Aron watches Kristi wipe a tear from her eye. Silently, he offers her his water bottle. She smiles, shakes her head and moves away.

Yeah, but’s it’s like not just another time, it’s another world. Another galaxy. Very- I dunno. She shakes her head, moves off down towards the path. Aron and Megan follow. They reach the bottom of the canyon. Another fork in the road. There is an awkward pause. Well, thanks, Aron. Yeah, we’d never have got there without you. Total pleasure- He pauses. Look, there’s this kinda secret place I know near here. Twenty minutes that way. It’s like the most fun you can have with your clothes on? Actually, it’s best without your clothes on, but that’s your call- The girls look at each other. It’s a bit of a climb... 15. We climb! They all laugh.

We’ll sign your time-card....as long as you tell me what to do now. I’m kinda stuck. Okay, push your butt hard on the wall and udge your way over, back and footing it. Then reach your right hand out there for those bomber jugs high on the left wall and bring your left foot onto that incut there. I didn’t understand a word of that. 16. Why don’t you just put your ass on my head. That Instructor Talk. Wooh...

And they keep on coming...It’s an act of faith. Keep climbing and lo! Holds will appear...take off as much as you dare...you’ll see why in a minute. MEGAN O/S You behave Aron Ralston or we’ll tell your Mother where you lure young girls. Swear I won’t look. Swear you won’t care when you get there! There’s a lot of air below him, a feeling of the vertiginous as much from the echo and the reflected light from the dome. Oh, about the holds? I forgot to say, when you get to the middle.... He lets go. ...there aren’t any....! And we see him drop 60 feet into the most exquisite emerald blue pool. Megan screams, has a heart attack. Oh my God! 17.

Then Megan appears. She’s left everything on except her shoes. Better hope you don’t sink with all those clothes on, Megan. Better hope I don’t land on your head, Aron. They crash into the pool, one after the other. They bob together in the centre, their breath coming in short excited bursts. The light seemingly coming from beneath them and rippling over the cavernous ceiling. They are laughing- at their own daring, at the craziness of where they are, at being alive. Oh my God, oh my God... Again. We’ve got to go again. And this time, film it! 18.

Scene Name: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVE. DAY.5050
Scene Action: They are drying off in the sun and picking at the remains of their lunch. Kristi is stretched out near Aron, taking in the sun on her near naked body. She is flicking through the stills on his camera. Megan has taken off most of her clothes to dry too. Still a touch self-conscious she sits a little bit away from them. Aron at the top of various snowy Colorado peaks. Some have far-reaching views, others are beset with snow flurries and Aron is only just visible underneath hood, helmet and balaclava. ARON V/O That’s Long’s Peak, Grays, Mount Oxford...Quandary. But always, it’s just Aron, centre of frame, taking a photo of himself. KRISTI V/O Could be anywhere. ARON V/O Big storm on Mt Princeton... KRISTI V/O Always on your own? ARON V/O That’s the point of soloing. You’re on your own. Then we see Aron and Kristi. Why? Nobody likes me. Or that awful band you’re always singing. Phish. Ugh. Exactly. Nobody likes me or my music. Gotta go solo. But Kristi really wants to know. 19. Seriously. Nobody to share the view with- though if you’re doing it in winter, hello, what view? The experience. Nobody to share that with. Don’t get it, Aron. It’s the challenge. You get yourself in trouble, you get yourself out. You live or die on your own decisions. Ultimate self- reliance. I guess. Seems kinda lonely. (shrugs) It’s the way I like it. Still a little mystified, Kristi gives the camera back to Aron. Lies back on the slab and closes her eyes to the sun. Hmm. Fabulous...You must be way behind schedule by now. He looks at her. Without turning her closed eyes from the sun, she smiles. Those Kangaroo rats you’re keeping waiting? Actually, I stopped the clock. This gets a response. She turns. You “stopped the clock”? I’m timing myself. Seeing if I can cut 45 minutes off the guide book time. When you guys are gone...click. Clock’s running again. Kristi doesn’t know quite what to make of this. But there’s just the hint of unease. 20. Huh. She turns back to the sun. No girlfriend, then, Aron? Nobody special. There’s always somebody special. There’s always the “one”. Not for me. They all say that. Sounds real certain about that. He shrugs. Don’t believe in all that ‘one’ baloney, that’s all. I bet you don’t. Said with more weight than she intended. She’s not sure why, but she’s going off him. Gets to her feet. Let’s hit the trail, Meg. This man’s on a schedule. No, I’m- But Kristi has clearly decided. Is getting into her trousers. (surprised by this shift) Oh. Okay.

You’ll never do that before dark. Sure I will. Come back with us, kick back, have a beer. Gotta do that canyon. This is you. They reach a cross-roads. One last photo? They pose with raven feathers in their hair as Aron turns the camera round. VIDEO STILL POV of all three, their heads tight together. Kristi is notably quieter, less smiley. Listen, some friends of ours are having a party tomorrow night if you want to swing by. Yeah? Where? But he is already delving in his back-pack, getting out his CD player and putting on his headphones. On the Moab road towards Denver? About forty miles out, we’re putting up this massive inflatable Scooby Doo. Can’t miss it. Cool. Reshouldering the pack, adjusting the head-phones. 22. Turn down that track and it’s about two miles further on. Starts late, goes right through. We’ll have some beers chilling for you. Sounds great. He checks his watch. Puts his hand to it. Click. Well, so long! Turns. A finger hits the button on the CD player. We see the CD begin to spin. The LED display tells us there’s The noise of five hundred people cheering blasts his- and our-ears. Good evening, Las Vegas...! Are you having a good time? Are you ready? Are you....readdddyyyy? The music crashes over us. Aron’s running feet negotiate the rough ground. Close up of Aron’s face, eyes already focussed on placing his feet. The measured breathing of an athlete pacing himself. Megan shouts after him. Scooby Doo, yeah? But he is in a different world. Do you think he’ll come? You liked him, right? She looks at Kristi looking at Aron. Nudges her knowingly. Yeah, you liked him. Kristi continues to stare at his disappearing figure. Know what? I don’t think we figured in his day at all. 23.

Scene Action: Aron’s eyes. We see what really figures in his day. His hands grip small holds. His feet smear on smooth rock. He is moving traversing across steep rock towards a water-worn, S-shaped log trapped across a narrow fissure. His mouth sings along to the music. He reaches the S-shaped log, crouches down, gives it two firm hits with his palm. Solid. He drops all the weight onto his arms, allows his body to dead-hang from the log for a couple of beats and then drops the four feet to the sandy ground below. His feet neatly hit the sand with a puff of dust. Nothing to it.

He easily scrambles over one and around another. Thump, thump. He gives it two firm hits with his palm again, an automatic instinct that accompanies every new boulder. The boulder doesn’t move. It’s a tight fit, but he’s like a contortionist and just squeezes through.

Then, he is stopped by one the size of a big refrigerator, jammed between the walls of the canyon, eighteen inches above the floor.

The music locks up too, looping continuously on two notes like bad techno. He pushes but nothing. Utter stillness. Only a flicker of panic in Aron’s blinking eyes reassures us that the world has not frozen. We see from his point of view. There’s a hell of a lot of stone above him. Then Aron slowly reaches back with his hand. With the careful precision of a lock-picker, he releases a part of his back- pack strap that has snagged. The music unjams too. He jumps up, brushes off the sand.

We’re already 60 feet below ground level it’s falling further in front of us. This is more like caving. He gets the map out. INT/EXT. SILHOUETTE PROFILE. CROSS SECTION OF THE CANYON. 6060 We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron moving within it. We track in and elide into a graphic view of him chimneying his way along the canyon- now only three feet wide at most. We see his skill, using his legs, back friction to body-walk along the smooth, sheer walls. He’s going deep.

Scene Action: He lifts his arms to protect his head, but his eyes remain open. Through his fingers, we see the next three seconds. The rock grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall. He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon wall and careers towards his right arm which he instinctively raises to protect his head. The rock smashes his right wrist and hand against the wall and drags it down, tearing the skin from him like a cheese- grater. 26. Aron is utterly powerless to stop its force, able only to land on his feet as the rock crunches to a halt, trapped in the slot. With his hand. Everything stops.

Scene Action: Adrenaline, searing roaring pain and panic. Get your hand outta there! Pulls and pulls. Yanks, twists, screws until his shoulder is almost dislocated. But nothing moves. Sweat on his face. Shit, shit, shit, SHIT! He pushes the boulder with his left hand to reverse the movement. Heaves at it with every sinew in his body. Nothing. Heaves again. And again and again, thrusting with his knees, thighs, shoulder, everything. Nothing. He rests for a while, taking huge breaths. This is- this is...ridiculous. Even gives a brief puff of laughter. Gathers himself. Slams upwards with his entire body, a man running full pelt into a door. Unnn...agh! Air explodes out of his lungs. There is the tiny, hollow sound of the boulder shifting fractionally. 27. A howl of phenomenal pain. No, no, no no no no. Damn! He reverses the fraction and goes limp, whimpering in sweat. His knees are bleeding from smashing them into the rock. He looks at his good fingers, now lacerated. He would collapse to the floor. But he can’t. He’s stuck. He grabs a bit of shirt, wipes the sweat away from his eyes. Loosens the strap on his back-pack, pulls it over his head and hula-hoops it around his body until it falls at his feet. With his free hand, he gets out the water bottle. Drinks deep. One gulp, two gulps, three- stops, mid fourth and backwashes it into the bottle. No. No more water. One-handed, he rescrews the lid with difficulty. Drops it back in his pack. Stop. Relax. Come on, think. He breathes and breathes, taking stock for the first time.

Compares left hand with right. The right wrist is now squeezed to the size of the width of his little finger. We know because he can barely get the little finger of his left hand in the gap. He’s still processing this whole event; how unlikely, how bizarre. Jesus. Jesus. How? How did you do this? You idiot, you total idiot! It’s crushed, man. It’s fucking dying. He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin on the canyon wall. Looks at it on his fingertips. Silence. Except for the tick, tick, of his watch. 28. One-handed, he undoes his watch. We see the time in big close-up. 3.14. Click. The second hand of the stop-watch comes to a halt. Aron looks up at the slit of sky. Shouts. Hello? Tries again. Kristi! Megan! Anyone there? Hello?

And.... 30. Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife. The rock explodes in his hand, showering us with fragments. The knife bounces off the arm, hits his shorts. As he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg. He pivots to try to catch it again, but gravity is quicker and the tool falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left foot. No, no, no......!

An ant runs over the knife. The stick returns. This time, its top is almost broken off to form a natural hook. We push in on the knife as the stick hooks through the little ring on the end of the knife. Slowly, slowly, it lifts.

As they do so, the sparkling crescent-shaped town of vehicles and encampments that is Burning Man is replaced by an astonishing sunrise. Their faces are burnished by the sun.

And then sunshine bursts upon him. He turns his face full into the sun that explodes the image of him into nothing. The screen whites out.

And then there’s another water bottle and an orange...The Gatorade lies on its side and the liquid seems to be slapping slowly, backward and froward like a Lava lamp, bulging with wetness and moisture.

Scene Action: Aron speaking to the video. He is beginning to fray at the edges a bit. Thinner, hollow-eyed. Still holding it together, but there are hints of darkness in his occasionally wayward delivery. It’s Monday. All day. Late for work...So. I spent the morning trying to rig the pulley again. Different anchors, worth a try. But there’s so much friction and it’s climbing rope. Too much bounce. What I need is a twenty metres of static rap rope. Nine point eight mill. Two grigris, a rack of carabiners, slings, a power drill and a bolt kit. A wry smile. That would do it. 46.

I have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left. And I peed twice already. It’s two days since I went last and then I nearly go wet myself. Bodily functions going weird on me. I saved the second lot in the Camelbak. Smells pretty rank, but it’ll settle, I guess. Chill it in the sand. Like Sauvignon Blanc... What else? I get fifteen minutes of sun at nine thirty.

Oh, yeah. That hurts. That hurts. Takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade. Then he presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm. Nothing. Repeats it harder. Then slashes hard, sawing viciously at the same point. Shit. Shit, shit. Releases the tourniquet, allowing blood flow to return to his arm and a series of angry red slash marks to reveal themselves. That it? Aron, that’s- that’s pathetic. Self-disgust on his face.

The bottle falls horizontally on his shorts and a leak of sacred fluid darkens his tan shorts. He whips it upright. No....! Useless idiot! Jesus, pay attention. He screws the lid carefully on. Shakes the bottle. Scarcely anything in there now. Can barely be bothered to lift the contact lens to his eye. But he does. Needs to take a rest in his harness after this gargantuan effort. Blinks a couple of times to get the lens settled. Shuts his eyes. The sound of slow and regular chipping. Dig, dig, dig.

Amazing. This boulder. There’s an enthusiasm in his eyes that isn’t entirely reassuring. He swings the camera right around. Films it. This boulder’s been waiting for me all my life. And all its life. Brings the camera back on himself. Isn’t that awesome? Since it was some bit of a meteorite a million billion years ago. Up there in space. It’s been waiting. To land here. Right here. And me, I’ve been moving towards it all my life. He leans in, earnestly trying to convey this idea. My DNA brought me right here. From the minute I was born. Every breath I’ve taken, every act has been leading to this. To this little crack in the earth’s surface. To this boulder. Cosmic. Incredible. Beautiful. 50. He stops, as if listening to the other half of this conversation. No, you don’t get it. I know you don’t get it. But it makes sense to me. Total sense. Gives up trying to convince the invisible audience. You had to be there. Laughs. Really. You had to be there. A long, violent burst of shivering afflicts him. He comes out of it, finally. This canyon’s like an ice-box. And the wind. Jesus, the wind.... Electronic static for a second as he switches off. Then he is back, the wind bringing him back to some sort of reality. I’ve got some American Express insurance that should cover the costs of the recovery operation. Bank accounts are all in credit. You’ll have to sell the house....All my life, I’ve been asking for this and I got it. The screen fills with static.

Complete Content: Aron is kneeling by the back door of his truck. His face is flush with the smooth metal, actually against it. A smile of love. He could be kissing it. But he’s actually trying to unlock it, his face inches from the lock, his trembling hand wrestling with the keys. Eventually, he gets the key in. Turns it. Bliss.

Scene Action: Aron is sitting, slumped against his truck, drinking the bottle of Gatorade. 56. C/U of his throat as it gulps and gulps. Gatorade is running all over his face. He can’t get it down fast enough. It is liquid pornography. Aron pauses to groan with sheer delight. Looks down at his useless hand. Starts laughing and laughing. With relief, with delight.

RANA O/S Who’s there? Rana, it’s Aron. RANA O/S Aron? Rana opens the door. We see her standing there in all her beauty. Behind her the room is lit softly. A fire burns in the grate. It is a vision of intimacy, comfort, safety. In slow motion, Rana smiles at Aron. She holds out her arms to him. We see Aron’s face. He is talking, but no sound is coming out of his mouth. Rana keeps smiling. Steps to one side to invite him in. Aron trying to communicate, trying to form words. Rana’s smile drops. She looks disappointed. Slowly, slowly, closes the door. Aron’s lips are moving. He is desperately trying to say something.

Scene Action: Aron’s lips are still moving, desperately. But he is in the rope bag. He never went anywhere. Oh, Jesus. He rips off the rope bag. Wailing, screams, cries. Finally, after so much control, so much order, this is despair. Naked, terrifying despair. A true rending of a soul gone beyond hope for release or rescue, into the darkest pit of loneliness. This is a man, dying on his own in the universe. 58. Oh, God, oh God, oh God.... Gradually the sobbing subsides. He is slumped by the boulder, encased in his own pity. Motionless for a long, long time.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. SUNRISE.170170
Scene Action: V/O Good morning, America! There’s a chorus of Good Mornings from a thousand American TV and radio shows from Texas to Oregon, Massachusetts to the Carolinas. Good morning, everyone! It’s seven o’clock in Canyonland, USA. Today, on the boulder, we’ve got a special guest- the self-styled American Superhero Aron Ralston. Shout it out, Aron! Applause from the studio audience. Where the hell did they come from? Flashes of Aron’s photos. Hero poses on top of various snowy peaks, crags, on bikes with huge panoramas stretching away beneath him. Thank you! Pleasure to be here! Suddenly, Aron has adopted the role of chat-show host, switching voices and persona with frightening dexterity. 59. Can I say a big hi to Mom and Dad in Englewood, Colorado? Mom and Dad! Never forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron? Umm. Yeah. Sorry I didn’t pick up the other night, Mom. Or all the other nights. Would have told you where I was going and- well- wouldn’t be stuck here now, would I? Well, I always like to say, your supreme selfishness is our gain, Aron. Anyone else you’d like to say hi to? Sure. Hi Brion at work! I’m not gonna make it in today, I’m afraid. A big laugh from the audience. A question coming in from another Aron, this one in Loser Canyon, thinking that even if Brion at work did notify the police, they’d put a 24 hour hold on it before filing a missing person’s report, which means that you’d only become officially missing midday Wednesday at the earliest?’ Right on the money, Aron. So they’d get about four hours searching before dark, then they’d call it off until Thursday first light. And how do you know all of this, Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah? Puts his finger to the invisible ear-piece as if talking to the questioner down the line. 60. Oh, well, I know all this ‘cos I’m a volunteer in the rescue service- I’m something of a big, fucking, hard, hero. I can do it all. On. My. Own. You see? Yes, I do see. And is it true that despite being a big, fucking, hard hero, officially the cleverest man in Colorado and on course to be the first ever to solo all the fourteeners’s in winter- On Your Own- you neglected to tell anyone where you were going? That is entirely correct. A pause. Anyone? Anyone. Oops. Oops. So, just to be clear, it’s just you, the crow and the kangaroo rat in on this one? Don’t let’s forget the big bag of piss. The bag of piss, ladies and gentlemen! Wooh! Applause and cheering echoes around the canyon as Aron picks up the Camelbak, toasts the imaginary audience. Thank you, thank you! 61. Suddenly, utterly, utterly sober, he stares straight into camera. I love you Mom. I’m so, so sorry. After a long moment, the screen is filled with static.

Still missed it. We can hear his heart pounding. Unnaturally fast. He holds his hand to it, trying to calm it, slow it down. A flash of a woman’s finger tracing a circle on his naked chest where his heart lies.

In all of the places in all of the world. Huh. Did all the routes, all the big descents. Not good enough. Not hard enough, right? The rat looks back. Right. Got what I wanted. Got what I asked for.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. DAY.174174
Scene Action: Aron is very still. Without warning, he suddenly tourniquets his arm again. Twice around the forearm, knotted twice and clipped with a carabiner that he twists up to tension. He folds open the knife, grasps it in his fist and picking a spot just above the rock’s grip on his right wrist, he plunges the blade into his arm. Up to the hilt. He lets go, leaving the knife embedded. He swoons, and stares at it, the whole picture going blurred for a moment. Then, he grasps the tool and wriggles it slightly. The blade connects with something hard. He taps the knife down and feels it knocking on the radius bone on his upper forearm. He puts his ear close to his arm and wiggles the knife again. We hear the thocking noise. Woah, that’s bone. He pulls the knife out, opening the wound. There’s barely any blood and he pokes around with a sort of detached curiosity. We can see the epidermis, thick and leathery. And the yellow layer of fat. Suddenly, he jams the knife against the bone. Aggghhhh! Pulls the knife out. Wipes the sweat away. So dry in the mouth, he is gagging. Pulls the lid off his water bottle. Shakes it. Drinks down the last precious drops. 63. Holds the bottle above his mouth to catch the final drops. Licks the inside as far as his tongue will reach. Screws the lid back on. Puts the bottle back down. 8.00 Loosens the tourniquet. Watches the blood come back into his arm. Picks up the video camera.

He swings the camera onto the bloody hole he has made in his arm. A short career in surgery as it turns out. I can cut down through the fatty tissue and some of the muscle. Might have chopped a tendon on the way, not sure. But. These knives. No way. The bone. No way it’ll get through the bone. Blunt. Next Christmas a proper Leatherman, yeah, Mom? Next Christmas.... He shrugs. Gave it a go. Long pause. 64. Out of water. An even longer pause. I’m really fucked now.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. NIGHT.178178
Scene Action: Aron listens to the music- a series of light, innocent scales with an almost childish tune attached. Entirely at odds with everything around him. A flash of a young Aron- maybe ten years old- playing on the piano in a light, sunny room. In between bouts of shivering, Aron continues to chip his own name. Tries to hum along to the scales. It sounds like the mumblings of dementia. Another flash of the young Aron at the piano. We move past him into the next room where his Mother is working at the kitchen table, surrounded by piles of paperwork. His Mother’s head nods slightly to the music. INT/EXT. VARIOUS.179179 65. The rest of Tuesday night and Wednesday and Wednesday night play out through the tripych. Repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there are three Arons doing the same thing. Sometimes, it’s Young Aron, or the past or the present running on different sections of the triptych at the same time. At key moments, it resolves to one image and then back again. Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch the loops happening again and again. This is particularly true inside the rope bag at night. When his light is switched on, it’s bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close-ups. Without water, his disintegration is terrifyingly fast. When the head-torch is off, we establish a night vision of green and blue that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images play out on the interior surface of the bag. The effect is like wraparound Imax, multi-screen Technicolor.

Everything comes together. Me, I chose it. Chose to turn away from everyone. Stone. Chose...this. Sort of perfect. Mom and Dad....I love you. Rana. Rana, I just couldn’t.....do it. Say it. Show it. But someone will. He’s fading out, like a radio station out of range. Pulls himself back for one last effort. This is important. I need you all to understand. Every one of you. I need you to understand that it’s okay. All of this... He smiles at the camera. A brave, unmanic, genuine smile. 68. I’m- I’m cool with it. At peace. It’s okay. Everything. Is. Okay. Goodbye. And he clicks the camera off.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. DAY.187187
Scene Action: Aron puts the camera down. With terrible slowness, he packs all the bits of his strange, trapped life back into his bag. Finally, there is nothing left to pack but the knife. He looks at its smashed-up blades, cleans them on his t-shirt. With a final effort, he folds the blades shut and puts it back in the sack. Sits back in the harness. Shuts his eyes. BIG C/U. DAY An ant crawls right across Aron’s lips and onto his cheek. No muscles twitch. He could be dead.

Scene Action: There are three, four ants on his face now. A shaft of sunlight hits Aron’s dangling foot. No movement. The shaft of sunlight moves up his body, finally hits his face. After an age, an eye opens slightly. Something makes the eye look up towards the light. Standing right in the glare of the sunlight stands a small boy. He can’t be more than three years old. Standing there in a red polo shirt. Right in the canyon. The boy smiles at him. Aron gets up and walks towards the boy, the sunlight hitting his face like a train. We can’t see his damaged arm, but it is clear that he is free. He keeps moving towards the boy. And the boy starts towards him, running until Aron crouches and lifts him, laughing into the sun. They are both so, so happy.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. DAY.190190
Scene Action: 69. Aron looks at his good hand. It’s swollen like an inflated prosthetic on top of his real hand. Suddenly, he has energy. He upends his rucsac with uncharacteristic carelessness, grabs the knife. Rips off his shoes and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm. Picks up the black, rounded, hammer rock again. Ignoring the pain, he starts hammering at the rock surface. Smash. Where has this huge energy come from. I hate this rock. The rage blooms. I hate this rock. I hate this fucking rock. A small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time. I hate this place. I hate this rock. I hate this fucking rock! With each individual word he gives a blow. The sock disintegrates under the battering. But he is oblivious. He stops hammering. His fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to the canyon floor. He pokes the thumb with the stubbed point of the blade. On the second prod, the blade punctures the epidermis and there is a clear hiss as gases escape. The look on Aron’s face tells us about the stench. Get rid of it, Aron. It’s dead. It’s gone. Garbage. Aron, you are not dying here. You are not dying here. He drops to his haunches, but the webbing stops him at his waist. He takes it off and drops down again in a squat. Yes. Yes. He pushes and pushes with his left hand under the boulder, creating maximum downward force on his right arm. Hard, harder. His teeth are clamped shut. No sound. 70. Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound echoes. He rises and looks at the bone pushing up violently against the skin. He touches the jagged edge. No sound. Now, he humps his body up and over the chockstone, smearing with his feet against the wall. He pushes his body further and further round the dark side of the chocktone with a silent, furious intensity. A second gun shot echoes around the canyon. He’s sweating heavily and yet has a euphoria in his eyes. He checks the underneath of his arm. Yep, another broken bone. He can rotate his forearm as if it’s a shaft inside a housing. Still, he makes no sound. There is a high-pitched ringing in his ears. Nothing else.

Scene Name: INT. CANYON. DAY.191191
Scene Action: Picks up the knife. Pauses, with the blade above his wrist. Here we go. He pushes the knife hard to the hilt in between two veins in his wrist. Sweat pouring out of him. His tongue flicks out automatically to catch the occasional drop. Sawing downwards, he makes as large a hole as he can without tearing any of the noodle-like veins. He puts the knife in his teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his right arm. Drops of sweat falling on the knife blade. He pulls muscle up, nearer the surface, allowing his knife to slice and pare away at a fragment of muscle bit by bit. It takes a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back to his teeth so his free hand can arrange the meat. Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice. Blood flows, though surprisingly little. He stops briefly to twist up the tourniquet. Silence. 71.

He uses them to bite into an edge of the yellowy tendon. Then squeezing and twisting, he tears away a fragment. Grip. Squeeze. Twist. Tear. Finally, he tears the last fibre of tendon. Stares at his handiwork. With a sniff of satisfaction, returns to his knife blade.

It lengthens like pulling a guitar string. Unimaginable pain builds in his body until finally the nerve snaps. And Aron snaps. Aaaagghh. 72. Retching, slumps in a heap, head lolling forward, his head buzzing and ringing with trauma. The numbers flick fast. There’s ten minutes gone in a flash. The numbers slow...and stop.

Sweat running in his eyes, blurred vision, rasping, parched breathing. And then he’s staggering backwards. Free. His hand, just stuck there, a stump in the crack. He stares at it. He’s out here. And his hand is in there. Weird. His head is swarming with colours, his legs faltering like a new foal. He stumbles up to the canyon wall. Stares close at his own obituary. No. Not yet.

He stuffs his arm into the empty Camelbak pack and throws the straps around his neck to make a sling. Packs his bag, water reservoir, video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope and heads off down the canyon. Turns. Goes back. Looks down at his feet. Sees a tiny hole that goes god-knows-where. Takes the watch out of his pocket. The second hand sweeps past.

Scene Action: The motion and energy of the action movie returns. It’s like Ray Liotta’s final day in Goodfellas; relentless, frustrating, pressure of life again now he’s free from his tomb. Deeper and deeper he goes, twisting and turning through the scoops of sandstone, his rope trailing behind him a hundred feet. We follow its progress snaking after him. Specks of blood on the canyon walls. The canyon becomes a chute, increasingly steep, deep and dark. But at the end, there is a glow of light, pink, red, soft, getting brighter by the step. He pushes forward, the rope whipping around the corners. Faster and faster until....

Scene Name: EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY.200200
Scene Action: ....we burst into dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf perched dizzyingly high above the canyon floor. It’s a two hundred foot sheer drop to the bottom. Vast cliffs face him opposite. He drinks in the sun, the space. Looks over the edge. Sees... Water. A stagnant pool of green water. Turns back, suddenly desperate, rabid. Is searching the rock for something. Doesn’t take long to find two clean, shiny, metal bolts drilled into the rock. Gets down on his knees and kisses them as he were the Pope on new soil. Feverishly Aron unravels the knots in the rope. Every single knot must be untied with his good hand and his teeth. Stops, suddenly overwhelmed with thirst and exhaustion. Reaches into his pack and pulls out the Camelbak. Empties urine all over his head. He is licking and retching all at the same time. Stops. Instantly. He can hear a noise. We can hear a noise. A shuffling, zipping sound. The rope is uncoiling over the edge, running faster and faster. There’s only a few feet left. He lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. Lies there whimpering. 74.

Another attempt, lost in the vastness of the canyon. The figures are disappearing in the shimmer. Help! 75. The figures stop. Turn. Help! A terrible pause. Help me! I need help! The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in close up as they come. Tears come, now as the shimmering figures shapes themselves into the first real people he has seen for five days. My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and I’ve been without food or water for five days. I cut my arm off this morning. I need medical attention. My name is Aron Ralston... They look at this refugee from a horror movie. He is staring at the water bottles hanging from their waist belts. This gives them a way into his world. The moment is broken as they hurry to offer him water. He pours it down his throat, bypassing the swallow mechanism entirely.

As he sits, his head slumps forward. He’s absolutely motionless. Erik tries to talk to him, but there’s a pop song in his head and he can barely hear him. Aron, are you okay? Stay with us, Aron. Jesus, he’s asleep. Aron! Wake up! Aron pulls his head up and sees in front of him a vision coming from the sky. Whirling and screaming, dust blasting everywhere. A helicopter.

ARON’S DAD This is a day every Father prays for. His beautiful daughter married to a fine boy- yes, you’re still a boy, Tim- Laughter from the crowd. ARON’S DAD - but today is particularly special for Donna and myself. A day we thought for a while might never happen. ARON’S DAD Not only do we welcome a new son into our family, but we have our son back. Which makes us the luckiest- and happiest- parents in the United States of America. There is applause from the crowd. Aron raises his Margarita glass in acknowledgement. ARON’S DAD And now he’s back, he can darn well fulfill his promise to his sister. Suddenly, Aron snaps to. What? Then, Sonja is dragging, pulling him out of his chair, leading him laughing and protesting as he realises what is going on. He is being led to a piano. This is a set-up. Everyone at the tables is laughing, cheering them on. No. Sonja, don’t do this. I can’t. 81. You promised, Aron. Yeah, but- - the only butt is sitting on that seat. And she plonks him on the piano stool. Sits down next to him. Aron looks genuinely terrified. Oblivious to what Sonja sees in his eyes, the crowd cheer the pair on. Oh my God. You’re scared? Yes. This is suddenly not a joke and she realises it. You can do it, Aron. He looks at her. She looks around at the expectant crowd who are beginning to hush. You’re gonna have to do it. They place their fingers on the keyboard. Three human fingers and one titanium one. They start. The note C played three times. C, C, C. Tentative. The crowd are silent, suddenly aware that this joke might not be funny at all. They’re really concentrating. C, B, A, B, C, D. The music is simple, melody full of childlike charm. E, E, E. The crowd are willing them on and they are beginning to flow. E, D, C, D, E, F. They almost stumble but recover. The crowd are utterly silent, on tenterhooks. On to the high notes. G, C.... 82. Aron jumps the octaves with his titanium finger. And Sonja and Aron’s faces split into the widest of grins. The crowd erupt in cheers and applause as Aron and Sonja hug each other as if they’ll never let go. Aron’s Mom and Dad take each other hands. They are both in tears. Promise kept. And she kisses his cheek.

It’s hard, you know? You wouldn’t bother if it wasn’t. That’s exactly the kind of thing I’m trying to change... Go figure, Ralston. Serious now. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But I have to. Yeah? She gives him a very direct look. What about the climbing? Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm / axe. He clinks the points together. She doesn’t laugh, maybe a smile. I’m gonna finish the fourteeners this winter or next. 84. Solo? Yeah. So much for change. Aron just stares. She turns away. Occupies herself with her drink. I killed us. I know that. I’m so sorry. For what I did. I couldn’t accept it. Couldn’t let anyone in. Didn’t have to be anyone, Aron. Just me. I know. Silence. Rana, when I was in the canyon, before I did it, when I thought I was dead, I was hallucinating and I saw this child, a little blond boy - Not Jesus please... He looked like my cousin Charlie, actually, but way too young...not him. Somebody else. Aron stands up injects some conviction, forces her to concentrate on him. I knew he was mine- my child- and that this was what lay in front of me. My future. Rana, this little boy, he- he saved me. Do you see? I thought maybe... 85. He looks at her. She doesn’t say anything. Her silence tells him everything. But it’s not going to be you, is it? She takes his hands in hers, smiles sadly. No, Aron, it’s not. But- - everyone who cares for you, a little bit of them dies each time you go back out there. (nods) Okay. Understood. Though it is breaking his heart. Rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek. I’m sorry.
