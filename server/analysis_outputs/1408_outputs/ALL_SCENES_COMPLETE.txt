Mike sits alongside a pile of his paperbacks? discoursing. Sure f these pieces have colorful wedding night murder. The caretaker who leaped to his death. The runaway horse that trampled the old lady. The war widow who went crazy and threw the baby down the well... The people go wide-eyed. Mike lets this hang... then deflates it. But there’s never any documentation! If you do one iota of research, the tragic event never happened1 It's just a marketing hook invented by desperate hotels when the interstate gets built too far away. The crowd doesn’t get it. One EMPHATIC MAN raises his hand. 6. Have you ever seen a poltergeist? (he reacts) See? That's exactly what I’m talking about. You didn’t hear one word I just said. I can type myself sick debunking these places, shooting arrows in the legends f and it only makes people want to stay there more. (she raises her hand) Well, my family's planning a trip this summer. Would you say there's a higher concentration of ghosts in New England or in the South? Mike wipes his face. I would say nowhere but no one’s listening. You'll probably want to pick-up my "Ten Haunted Antebellum Mansions." Mike is signing paperbackst rote, the same autograph over and Of course, I try to be scientific. I travel with an EMF meter, an infrared camera... a full-range spectrometer. But I’ve never had to use them, because there's nothing to record! Then — a HARDBACK enters frame. He looks up, surprised. A NERVOUS WOMAN holds the book. It’s a dusty, faded copy of Mike's early novel, "The Road Back Nowhere.” The artwork is Jesus. What rock did you find that under? Ebay. 7. Wow. Haven’t seen one of these in years. (awkward) How much did it... go for? The woman bites her lip, preferring not to say. Well, there weren't many bidders. (she smiles) But it's a lovely book. Are you going to write another one like this? — young and optimistic. Mike’s face falls. Nope. That was a different guy.

Scene Name: INT. OLIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT2727
Scene Action: An impeccable Edwardian study. Oak paneling. Fine books. An antique desk with a lozenge-shaped green lamp. Olin opens a humidor. Cigar? No, thank you. I don’t smoke. 20. Olin's eyes shift to the cigarette behind Mike's ear. Mike sees this. I quit years ago. (he starts to explain) The cigarette behind the ear is... I dunno. Habit. Part affectation, part superstition. A writer thing. Well, then, do you drink? Of course! I just said I'm a writer. Olin smiles thinly. He opens a liquor cabinet and removes a fine BOTTLE OF COGNAC. Remy 1939. Exquisite, Runs about $800 a bottle, when you can find it — (he raises his hand) I appreciate the bribe, but I intend to stay in that room. (put off) How long? How long? Er, my usual is overnight. Oh. I see. (he purses his lips) Nobody has ever lasted more than an hour. Mike takes this in, then cracks up, PARODYING Olin with a silly Transylvania accent. Oooo! Bleh! "Nobody has ever lasted more than an hour. When the clouds pass over the moon, the spirits rise from the family graveyard to haunt the ballroom. " 21. Olin stares, unamused. I don’t know why you’re mocking me. I am genuinely, to the best of my ability, trying to help you. No, you're just playing a little game, which frankly I find tiresome, You're "selling the mystique." But eventually, we both know you’ll give me the key, I’ll write my story, and your bookings will go up 50%. Olin is repelled. Mike smirks and pulls out his mini- recorder. Do you mind if I record our conversation ? (he waits; beat) Good. I'll take that as a yes. Mike hits "RECORD.” The LED glows red, like an eye, and the little wheels start spinning... Olin glares, his politeness fading. Sir, you completely misunderstand the situation. The Dolphin may not have the cachet of the Plaza or the Carlyle... but we run 90% occupancy. (emphatic) This isn't about my concern for the hotel, OR about my concern for you. Frankly -- selfishly --- I don’t want you to enter 1408, because I don’t want to have to clean up the mess. Olin lets this chilling thought hang. Mike’s eyes widen. Hotels are all about presentation and creature comforts.., though behind the scenes, we witness quite the bit of nastiness. (heavy) 22. But my training is as a manager, not a coroner! Under my watch there have been four deaths. Four! After the last one, I said enough. I forbade any guests from ever entering again. And that last suicide was... Randolph Hyde? 1996? An orthodontist who slit his wrists and cut off his genitals? Yes. You've done your homework. Grievously, since the hotel opened 95 years ago, there have been seven jumpers, four overdoses, five hangings, three m -- Three mutilations. Two stranglings (into the MINIRECORDER) "Manager Gerald Olin is well-versed in the hotel's tragic history, dryly reciting the docket of carnage like a bookkeeper discussing his ledger.” (he frowns) You think you're clever?! Well in your investigation, did you discover the twenty-two natural deaths? Mike leans forward, interest piqued. "Natural"? Uh, no. What — You didn’t find them, because they're not reported in newspapers. But all told, 56 people have, died up there. Mike is momentarily speechless. Olin pulls out a small key and opens his desk bottom drawer. He removes a BULGING FILE and brings it around to Mike. Olin stares a moment —- then sits next to him. 23. You know nothing. 1408's guests have died of heart attacks, strokes, drownings — "Drownings"? Yes. Mr. Grady Miller died drowning in a bowl of chicken soup. (taken aback) H-how? How indeed? Isn't that interesting? (he PATS the folder) And you're welcome to read all of it. Every word! I'll even give you my office! You can peruse the materials to your heart's content. You can take notes. Put it all in your book! (pause; he turns somber) In return, my only condition... is that you don't stay in the room. Mike eyeballs the file. Considering. Then — I never got that drink. Olin smiles a flicker, then gets up for the Cognac. He takes out a crystal snifter, wipes it clean, carefully pours... Mike notices a silver DESK FRAME. He furtively cranes around... to check out who's in it. And — it’s a calendar. Olin hands Mika the drink. Mike gratefully snorts it, enjoying the flavor, the spreading warmth. Then, he looks up. No. Dammit to HELL! Olin BLOWS UP and angrily THROWS the file at Mike. 24. Fine! READ the blasted file! Read it anyway! (livid) Once you see it, you won't WANT to go in the room! Mike is stunned at this outburst. Hesitant, he opens the TOP FOLDER. Inside is a pile of wrinkled yellow newsprint. Olin testily narrates from memory. The first victim! Kevin O'Malley. A sewing machine salesman who checked into the hotel opening week, October 1912! (he winces at the photo) He... cut his own throat? Yes. But that's not the horrific part. Afterward, in a fit of insanity, he tried to stitch himself back up with a sewing needle before he bled to death. Mike makes a face. Jesus... Mr. Enslin! No one needs to know you didn't go in. I’ll give you a fake receipt1 You can take are identical, nobody will know the difference. Hey, my readers expect the truth — No, your readers don’t expect much of anything — except grotesquerie (snide, from memory) "The headless ghost of Eugene Rilsby, forever walking his deserted farmhouse. The Barking Phantom of Mount Hope Cemetery " 25. (surprised) How do you know that?! I've done my own research! Your books are easy to find — in the cheap paperback section. (beat) And they are completely cynical. The work of a talented, intelligent man who doesn't believe in anything but himself. Mike reacts, pissed. Where the fuck do you get off (hurt) This meeting's over — Oh please. Quit acting like a sore schoolgirl. (calming) I said you were talented. There was that first book... I -— I rather enjoyed that. It was popular. Hardback. Er... what was it called? "The Road To Nowhere" --? (uneasy) "The Road Back Nowhere." That was sort of... a gilded memoir? Travels of a young man -— (defensive) Only parts of it were true -— The father seemed like a real s.o.b. — Mike seethes. He hits "STOP” on the recorder. He jumps up. Give me my key. Mr. Enslin -- 26. Give me my key! Do you know why I can walk into any spooky old room? Because I know that ghoulies and ghosties don’t exist. (dark) And that’s good, because I also know there's no God to protect us from them, if they did.

Scene Name: INT. 14TH FLOOR - SAME TIME3030
Scene Action: Mike peers out. It's a perfectly uneventful corridor — red- and-gold carpet, drab end tables, old-tyme light fixtures. Your floor. Mike waits for Olin to take a step — but the man is immobile. I'm afraid this is as far as I go. The room is at the end of the hall to the right. Mike nods, a tad apprehensive. He exits — on legs that seem heavier. Mike takes a few steps, then turns. Olin stands framed in the elevator, an ordinary man in a plain suit. Hands clasped, face withdrawn, he sighs. Good luck. 29. Olin pulls out the bottle of Cognac and tosses it. Startled, Mike catches it. He starts to respond — but the doors SHUT. Olin is gone. is now alone. He hoists his duffel, then walks slowly down the hushed hallway. Past 1401... 1402... Mike examines Olin's file. INSERT - FILE A grisly PHOTOGRAPH marked "KEVIN O'MALLEY." He lies dead in the bathtub. His eyes are wide, his throat gashed open, a sewing needle protruding from raw flesh. grimaces. He walks past 1404... past a moldering room service tray. On the plate are remains of a beef burger soaked in red ketchup. A fly buzzes... INSERT - FILE Back to the photos. Mike flips to a nasty half-covered BODY in bed. The sheets are soaked. Mike is getting rattled. He makes a turn. 1406 goes by... 1407... wood-paneled doors and elegant wallpaper... Mike finds a scratched NOTE on hotel stationery. INSERT - FILE Connecticut Turnpike” Mike stops, considering this oddity. He looks up — and realizes he's in front of 1401. Huh? Mike looks around, confused. Somehow, he's back at the elevator.

Complete Content: Mike peers out. It's a perfectly uneventful corridor — red- and-gold carpet, drab end tables, old-tyme light fixtures. Your floor. Mike waits for Olin to take a step — but the man is immobile. I'm afraid this is as far as I go. The room is at the end of the hall to the right. Mike nods, a tad apprehensive. He exits — on legs that seem heavier. Mike takes a few steps, then turns. Olin stands framed in the elevator, an ordinary man in a plain suit. Hands clasped, face withdrawn, he sighs. Good luck. 29. Olin pulls out the bottle of Cognac and tosses it. Startled, Mike catches it. He starts to respond — but the doors SHUT. Olin is gone. is now alone. He hoists his duffel, then walks slowly down the hushed hallway. Past 1401... 1402... Mike examines Olin's file. INSERT - FILE A grisly PHOTOGRAPH marked "KEVIN O'MALLEY."

On the plate are remains of a beef burger soaked in red ketchup. A fly buzzes... INSERT - FILE Back to the photos. Mike flips to a nasty half-covered BODY in bed. The sheets are soaked. Mike is getting rattled. He makes a turn. 1406 goes by... 1407... wood-paneled doors and elegant wallpaper... Mike finds a scratched NOTE on hotel stationery.

He stands on his tiptoes and SHOUTS up into it. Hellooo! -Hello, asshole! You're gonna have to try harder! (he smirks) Nice and HOT up there?? Mike wipes his brow. He realizes he's sweating. Mike runs to the THERMOSTAT and checks it. It’s now 84. Oh, for God's sake. Mike pushes the "down" arrow again. Nothing. He BANGS it. Irked, he grabs the clunky telephone, peers at the archaic dial, then sticks his finger in the hole and dials "O." It spins. Click-click-click-click-click. Then — Hello! This is Mr. Enslin in Room 1408. Good evening. Are you ready to check out? "Check out"?! (he chuckles mordantly) Why would I do that, when there a such wonderful maid service? (beat) And so discreet! (beat) No, I just need someone to fix my thermostat. This room's on fire. Of course, sir. We'll send an engineer right up. Thanks. 37. Mike hangs up. Beat. Through the wall, the baby CRIES. Waaah! Waaah...! Mike considers it all. He sits on the sofa, then starts his recorder. "Hotel rooms are naturally creepy. I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many were sick? How many lost their minds? (beat) "How many died?" Mike thinks. He unzips his duffel, slides over his LAPTOP, and carefully removes a small EQUIPMENT CASE. Inside is Mike dims the room. Then, he turns on the UV light. It HUMS, emitting a weird blue glow. He holds the tube over the carpet stain, and it GLOWS, vivid and brackish. Hm. Mike waves the UV light around the room.

Mike is losing his equilibrium. God, I feel like I smoked some cheap dope! He straightens the three paintings, then turns away. Mike takes a step — then — suddenly gets a look. He spins! The paintings are still straight. Hm. Mike queasily sits, putting his head between his legs. Overheated, he fumbles for his recorder, What did Olin say? (dizzy) Something about poison gas...? A woozy, unclear contemplation.... when — BZZZZ! Mike jerks. BZZZZZ! It’s the door, He pops from his trance. W-who is it?? Engineering. You got a problem with your heat? Mike scurries to the door. He peers through the EYEHOLD. Through the glass, a hairy New York ENGINEER in overalls. Good enough. He goes to open the door. He pulls — and it’s stuck. It won't budge. Mike struggles with the handle. 39. The door’s stuck! Can you give it a shove? (beat) I ain’t touching it. Mike reacts, irritated. He tugs harder, wrenching with all his might — when, it suddenly releases and SLAMS open. BAM! Mike tumbles, off-balance. opens wide. Revealed is the ENGINEER, a huge, heavyset man. He carries a steel toolbox. Is it too hot or too cold? Oh, it’s definitely too hot. C’mon in. The box is right here — Mike strides over to the thermostat. He starts to gesture to the panel — when he realizes — he's... alone. Confused, Mike turns. The guy is still standing in the doorway. Mike gestures again, for emphasis. I said... the box is here. know where the fuck it is. But I ain’t going in that room. What! Mike glowers, put-out. You just have to walk seven or eight feet — I said I’m not goin’ in! You know what happened in there? Yes, I'm quite aware -— 40. Look, I'll talk you through it. Any jackass can fix that thing. (beat) Just remove the panel. The Engineer waits, feet planted. Mike stares in disbelief. Then, beaten, he pulls off the thermostat PANEL. Inside are springs and levers. Okay. Now -- inside, you see a coil? Yes. Good. Now above that coil is a little tube filled with mercury. That's supposed to activate the contact switch, but this hotel's so old, half the shit don't work. (beat) Just give the tube a little tap. Mike glares, unsure. Just tap the thing! Mike relents. He FLICKS the tube. The mercury suddenly emits a blue SPARK, then rolls downward. The system CHURNS, then the air-conditioning BLOWS on. Mike smiles t relieved. You're a genius. Let me get you a tip — Mike turns to thank the man — and he’s GONE. Huh? Bewildered, Mike runs to the door. He peers out.

Busy traffic, thirteen stories down. tries to stay calm. Just ignore it.. Don’t worry... He presses his face to the wall, then... carefully, starts to inch along the ledge. He slides his left toot. Beat. He slides his right... He doesn't dare lean back. He blindly reaches out, gripping the next section of cornice. Okay. He slides his left foot. Then his right. His face is sweating. He reaches... fingers slipping... then, his hand finds the next cornice. Good. He slides again. He reaches — and still no window. CU - MIKE Cheek pressed to the dusty brick, he is confused, 60. Where the hell is it? Mike slides his left leg over. His right leg over. Starting to jitter, he reaches again. And — no window. (getting worried) Where is it?! He reaches further... straining... then slides again. Nothing. WHERE IS IT??! Daring gravity, he leans back, to get a look -- SUPERWIDE - THE BUILDING And, THERE ARE NO OTHER WINDOWS. THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS ONE CONTINUOUS SURFACE OF BRICK, EXCEPT FOR MIKE AND 1408. Mike SCREAMS, horrified. NOOOOO!!! He flounders, stunned. Mike slips. AGGHH! Mike falls, BANGING his face on the wall. He DROPS, about to plummet, desperately clambering, scratching his fingers into the old brick/when — BAM! One hand snags the ledge as it passes by. Chest heaving, hysterical, Mike catches his breath. The wind pelts him. Mike whimpers. Then, he resignedly starts shimmying back to 1408. Slowly, then, faster... his expression despondent... TIGHT - MIKE'S HANDS 61. pull him along, Struggling to return to the hell he was escaping. Mike finally reaches his room. Quivering, sucking in all his strength, he LIFTS HIMSELF UP onto the ledge. A shaky beat — then, he looks back inside. across the room, RIGHT UP TO THE MAP on the door. ZOOMING TIGHTER, until the MAP FILLS THE FRAME. And — it's alive, the black lines slithering around like worms. The map rearranges itself, doors and walls moving about. goes pale. Suddenly -- the Portly Lady steps out into the window. She is sobbing. May Jesus forgive me... (beat; she scowls hatefully) And FUCK YOU, HENRY SMITH! She starts to jump -- when she suddenly sees Mike. A bizarre discombobulation, then she lashes out at him, punching at him like the movements we saw earlier. Freaked out, she leaps. Ahhhhh! She hurtles past. Mike gasps and jerks away. Scared, he tumbles back inside.

Busy traffic, thirteen stories down. tries to stay calm. Just ignore it.. Don’t worry... He presses his face to the wall, then... carefully, starts to inch along the ledge. He slides his left toot. Beat. He slides his right... He doesn't dare lean back. He blindly reaches out, gripping the next section of cornice. Okay. He slides his left foot. Then his right. His face is sweating. He reaches... fingers slipping... then, his hand finds the next cornice. Good. He slides again. He reaches — and still no window. CU - MIKE Cheek pressed to the dusty brick, he is confused, 60. Where the hell is it? Mike slides his left leg over. His right leg over. Starting to jitter, he reaches again. And — no window. (getting worried) Where is it?! He reaches further... straining... then slides again. Nothing. WHERE IS IT??! Daring gravity, he leans back, to get a look -- SUPERWIDE - THE BUILDING And, THERE ARE NO OTHER WINDOWS. THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS ONE CONTINUOUS SURFACE OF BRICK, EXCEPT FOR MIKE AND 1408. Mike SCREAMS, horrified. NOOOOO!!! He flounders, stunned. Mike slips. AGGHH! Mike falls, BANGING his face on the wall. He DROPS, about to plummet, desperately clambering, scratching his fingers into the old brick/when — BAM! One hand snags the ledge as it passes by. Chest heaving, hysterical, Mike catches his breath. The wind pelts him. Mike whimpers. Then, he resignedly starts shimmying back to 1408. Slowly, then, faster... his expression despondent... TIGHT - MIKE'S HANDS 61. pull him along, Struggling to return to the hell he was escaping. Mike finally reaches his room. Quivering, sucking in all his strength, he LIFTS HIMSELF UP onto the ledge. A shaky beat — then, he looks back inside. across the room, RIGHT UP TO THE MAP on the door. ZOOMING TIGHTER, until the MAP FILLS THE FRAME. And — it's alive, the black lines slithering around like worms. The map rearranges itself, doors and walls moving about. goes pale. Suddenly -- the Portly Lady steps out into the window. She is sobbing. May Jesus forgive me... (beat; she scowls hatefully) And FUCK YOU, HENRY SMITH! She starts to jump -- when she suddenly sees Mike. A bizarre discombobulation, then she lashes out at him, punching at him like the movements we saw earlier. Freaked out, she leaps. Ahhhhh! She hurtles past. Mike gasps and jerks away. Scared, he tumbles back inside.

Mike spins away. Kevin CHASES. Freakily gurgling, "Fix it! Fix it!" 76. barrels through the tiny space. Rushing for his life. Kevin O'Malley SKITTERS after him. Mike races, reaching THE T-JUNCTION He squirms down the RIGHT VENT. He makes it a few feet, when -- CRUNCH! THE.VENT COLLAPSES. RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!! As if a giant hand has squeezed it like a Coke can. Mike yelps and jolts back. The Vent continues CRUSHING IN, moving closer! He turns — comes Kevin, his face a horrible rictus, waving the needle. crawls like hell! Faster, towards the Where in the distance he can see the OPENING to 1408! A slim square of light — keeps CRUSHING! Metal SMASHING closer — scurry as fast as they can. SLAM! Kevin O'Malley STABS his needle into Mike's leg. Mike SCREAMS, pained. He KICKS backward. His foot SHUSHES through Kevin's head, like a sponge. Kevin O'Malley collapses, the CRUSHING VENT SQUEEZING him out of view. Mike speeds faster.

TIGHT - MIKE He lies there, overwhelmed. Breathing in fits, face drenched in sweat, absolutely dumbstruck. He looks up at the ceiling... then around the room. Beat. I need a drink. Mike staggers over to the Mini-Bar. He whips open the little refrigerator door - then gasps. INSIDE THE MINI-BAR is a MINIATURE SET of OLIN'S OFFICE. A TINE LITTLE OPEN SIDE IN HIS WING-CHAIR, sipping Cognac. Mike grimaces, flabbergasted. What are yon doing in there?? (vexed) Where’s my BOOZE?! Olin stiles? unruffled. I was just checking, sir. Are your accommodations exceeding your expectations? What do you want from me?! No no no. What do you want? What do YOU want, Mr. Enslin? You sought this room. I was doing my job! (like he misheard) Sorry? 78. My job! I'm a writer! I tell people the truth! Hm. Olin swirls his Cognac. That's right, you don't believe in anything. You like shattering people's hopes. That's bullshit! Why do people believe in ghosts? For fun? No. They want the promise of something after death... A COLLAGE of tearful VOICES... SORROWFUL VOICE #1 She’s in a better place, Mike... SORROWFUL VOICE #2 She was in so much pain ,.. SORROWFUL VOICE #3 I'm sure she's smiling down at us right now... Mike winces, agonized. How many spirits have you broken? AAAAAAH! Enraged, Mike SLAMS shut the Mini-Bar. I WANT MY DRINK!! Mike spins. He looks around, then spots the Cognac in the bedroom. Ah! He beelines for the bottle, then snatches it up. He uncorks it and thirstily chugs the drink. Pause — then he calms. He glances down at the hotel Bible. Curious, Mike picks it up, then flips through. 79. INSERT - BIBLE The PAGES are all now blank. Weird. frowns. Then, a faraway voice... Why is our bible purple? Mike looks up. There is a spectral The Enslin family’s old apartment, set-up as a grim hospice. Gracie lies in bed, in a pink butterfly nightgown, in the final, terrible stages of cancer. She’s skeletal. Waxen. Lily sits by her, gripping a purple BIBLE. She laughs awkwardly. I — I dunno. It was a wedding present. (she caresses it) But it's nice. The cover is real leather... Are there people where I'm going? You're not going anywhere. That isn’t what Daddy said. We reveal Young Mike sitting in the window, smoking a cigarette. He stubs out the smoke. Daddy says a lot of stupid things. (he comes over to the bed) You're too young to understand, but when you grow up and become an adult... (he forces a smile) 80. you'll realize I'm crazy. Grade giggles. Mike gently brushes her cheek. Daddy, everyone dies. A tense pause. Lily glances at Mike. He struggles to be consoling. Y-you're right. Everyone dies... (she jumps in) And then you'll go to a better place. And lots of people will be there... (her voice cracks) All your friends.... And you’11 be able to run around again... play... Grade looks up at Mike. Do you believe that, Daddy...? A profound silence. He stammers, stuck. Grade stares pleadingly. Waiting. Then — Yes. I do. (she breaks into a smile) Good. Then I do too. We hold on her heartfelt face. Flames RAGE. It1s a cremation. A tiny coffin enters the burning fire. 81. PRESENT - MIKE He sobs, pained. Wincing at this memory. The crematorium glows white, then blazes piercingly hot. The casket disappears into the heat. Young Mike sits on Grade's bed, weeping. He's unshaven, distraught, clinging to her old pink nightgown. Grade is gone. Lily can't even look at him. She could have hung on. But we had to fill her head! With all those fucking stories about the glorious afterlife... (crying) Why do you have to blame anyone?! Mike throws down the nightie. I gotta get out. He jumps up and charges out of the apartment. SIAM!

Mike reaches out... straining... and takes her hand. I'm sorry. Sorry I blew it... sorry for everything... Everything? For — Grade... You had nothing to do with Grade. He looks in her eyes, seeing the truth of his life. Then — I'm sorry for running away. For making mistakes. For abandoning everyone... 93. CLOSEUP - LILT She nods, acceptingly. You should get some rest.

She shivers, her little body wispy... So cold... 106. Mike’s face caves. Suddenly overpowered by feelings, he RUSHES FORWARD and GRABS her tightly. Oh Grade, Grade, Grade... TIGHT - MIKE AND GRACIE His eyes are shut, clinging to her tiny body. The most electric thing he’s ever felt. She speaks, barely a whisper. It won’t let me stay. He looks up, as she convulses violently. Her face damp with sweat. He touches her forehead — it's burning up. No! Honey, no one’s gonna take you. Her eyes brim with tears of pain. Do you love me, Daddy? You know I do! I wish we could stay together. You, me, Mommy — We can! I promise we CAN! Happy, she brushes her hand to his cheek. CLOSE ON - MIKE'S CHEEK As she withdraws her hand, it leaves a TRAIL OF ASH. unexpectedly collapses like a balloon that's lost all air. Grade? She falls back, eyes frozen. She's stopped breathing. GRACIE?! 107. Mike shakes her, but she is still. NO!!! Mike immediately begins CPR. He puts his mouth over hers, breathing air into her lost lungs. Not again! Goddammit, NOT AGAIN! He furiously begins CPR. He begs, between breaths. Stay... stay... keeps pressing on her chest. Through his face, we see vain hope. Despair. And finally... loss. Shaken, he pulls his hands away. They are COVERED IN ASH. Grade's body has TURNED TO DUST. She is gone. Mike is immobile. Hands gray with the remains of his child. His heart is empty. Absolute sorrow. Grieving, eyes sunken, he looks up. Just wanting it to end. slowly reacts, sobbing. And — MIKE’S EYES go wide. And?? starts FLICKERING. The LED numbers flash randomly... 108. waits despondently. Around him, the ash disappears. The gray dust dissipates, like a dream, into nothingness. Mike stares, uncomprehending. Until he peers up — and GASPS. 1408 has RETURNED TO ITS OPENING STATE. No water damage. Windows back. Everything restored to when we first entered. goes into shock. Dumbstruck. His voice cracking. Why don't... you just kill me? Mike trembles, utterly desolate. Mike’s skin gets clammy. He staggers, lightheaded. UNLESS, YOU CHOOSE TO END IT. Something FALLS right behind him. Mike turns — hangs, attached to the ceiling. Below it is a chair. nods, acquiescing. Mike is weeping. Confused. Unable to think clearly, he steps onto the chair. He slowly draws the rope around, his neck. 109. Mike stands there, eyes glassy. Pondering his fate. But — not jumping. Emotions and regrets pound through his body. He grips the rope tight... then suddenly pulls it off, crying. I... can’t. (distraught) I'm sorry! I just... can't do it. The VOICE booms, furious. THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO OPTION! The TV suddenly turns on. We see Lily, guilelessly entering the Dolphin lobby. face falls, horrified. Lily...? (mocking) YES, "LILY"! I'LL TAKE HER IN N-NO! Lily's cellphone sharply RINGS. She answers. Hello? We hear MIKE'S SIMULATED VOICE. MIKE’S VOICE (over cellphone) Lily, it’s me. Mike? 110. MIKE’S VOICE Hurry! Come up to my room. gapes in horror. Leave her out of this!!! Lily enters the elevator. The doors shutting... starts freaking out. He spins, then notices his CELLPHONE on the floor. Its screen flickers. Ah! Mike looks around, paranoid, then grabs the phone. Its power blinks. Frantic, he hurriedly DIALS Lily. He bites his nails. KING! RING...! She rides up the elevator, oblivious. C' mon, c’mon... More RINGING. Then — a MAN answers, through garbled STATIC. Hello? A discombobulated beat. It’s a wrong number, but... strangely familiar. Hello?! Who -- who is this???

Mike trips, falling. SLAM! The floor is crazy. Mike tries to get up, attempting to climb. His naked hands fall on hot carpet, singeing him. Mike SCREAMS in pain. But he keeps going. YOU CAN'T SAVE HER. SHE'S DOOMED! The elevator opens on the 14th floor. Lily steps out... WIDE - THE ROOM Mike crawls upward, his equilibrium reeling. The SLANT is now INSANE. The floor is practically vertical. Mike hangs onto the furniture, like a rock climber. 112. Using all his might, he hoists himself. The thermostat keeps rising. 140. 145... Mike struggles to move.

His feet STICK to the hot melting carpet. He wants to move, but collapses. The fabric burns into his hands. The door is hopelessly far away. In anguish, unable to crawl, he weakly glances at the TV. Lily walks down the hall. Approaching... CLOSEUP - MIKE In a final gasp at salvation, Mike whispers. Lily. Go... Lily takes a step, then suddenly stops. Like she heard him. She contemplates this sensation, her face a mix of strange emotions. Then — she suddenly turns and LEAVES. sobs, relieved. runs. Fast, faster. THUNDERS, furious. Mike is overwrought. Volatile, rapturous. He slowly looks up... and then his expression darkens. 113. I know I’ve lived the life of a selfish man... (pause) But I don’t have to die that way. Mike reaches for the fallen BOOK OF MATCHES. He stares — then rips out a match and STRIKES it against the covert with its funny little doorman. An instant, TINY FLAME. Maybe this room isn’t real. Maybe I'm not even real. (wheezing, desperate) But this fire... is real. Mike crawls across the floor. Holding the match out, straining to touch it to a CURTAIN... When — WHOOSH! A HUSH OF WIND from the air conditioning vent blows it out. YOU’D JUST BE KILLING YOURSELF. Mike considers this... then nods. As long as I kill you too, I can rest in peace. Suddenly, Mike grabs Olin’s. Mike pops the cork, then lights the ENTIRE BOOK OF MATCHES. The FLAME BLAZES bright, a crazy glow under his face. Mike shoves it in the bottle, lighting the flammable liquid. Mike spins and HURLS the MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. BLAMMMM!!! The entire ROOM explodes in flames. The FIRE instantly spreads, igniting the carpet and furniture. FSSST! The SPRINKLERS COME ON — the room's desperate attempt to save itself. Mike laughs manically. 114. Too LATE! You’ll never hurt anyone again. The CURTAILS flare up, blindingly orange. The blaze SEARS, the walls erupt. Mike stands inside the inferno, seething. In a final act, he "The decor is tattered and the staff surly... but on a Shiver Scale, I award the Dolphin Hotel ten skulls." The flames congeal, then DETONATE.
