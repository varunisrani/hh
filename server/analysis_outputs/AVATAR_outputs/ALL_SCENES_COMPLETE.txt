SCENE 1:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. CITY - NIGHT11
Scene Action: A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing -- JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years. Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish advertizing. They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy. The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous, isolated souls.

SCENE 2:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT22
Scene Action: The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom. Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. -- 2. The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a century, is making a comeback. These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are... Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side, pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the other, and so on. His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A “Born Loser” tattoo prominent on his shoulder. I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. Jake struggles with his pants a long time.

SCENE 3:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT33
Scene Action: Not the kind of place you’d bring your mom. We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets, CLAP and WHOOP. Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer. A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men RUNNING on antelope legs. CU JAKE, watching what he can’t have. Expression stony. Let’s get it straight up front. I don’t want your pity. I know the world’s a cold-ass bitch. Jake’s eyes shift -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd. A MAN on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he’s with. Hard. She cowers but he’s got her arm, shouting, raising his fist. An eternal tableau. People look away. CU JAKE -- not looking away. 3. You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak. TIGHT ON JAKE’S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair. TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward. It’s just the way things are. And nobody does a damn thing. Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans down and grabs one leg of the man’s barstool -- and YANKS. The chair flips. The guy goes down HARD and -- JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor. THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling... All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

SCENE 4:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT44
Scene Action: THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash. Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He’s bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight. I hope you realize you’ve just lost a customer! He collapses onto his back, panting. (to himself) Candy ass bitch. 4. He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking -- then shouts jauntily to no one in particular -- If it ain’t rainin’ we ain’t trainin’! CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled amongst the trash, getting drenched. TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him. Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him. He squints up at -- TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors. AGENT 1 Are you Jake Sully? Step off. You’re ruinin’ my good mood. AGENT 2 It’s about your brother.

SCENE 5:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT55
Scene Action: DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN’S FACE. He looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY. The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet. WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake stares down at his own face. Jesus, Tommy. 5. The Suits’ concern was touching. AGENT 1 Your brother represented a significant investment. We’d like to talk to you about taking over his contract. The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape dispenser, like it’s a package for shipping. The cardboard coffin is rolled into the furnace. The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers. PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light. Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin’ sent someplace I was gonna regret. INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the cardboard; TOMMY’S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame but not touched by it, as we -- JAKE’S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath. JAKE’S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --

SCENE 6:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. CRYO VAULT66
Scene Action: JAKE’S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY toward us. Wherever we are, we’re not on Earth. Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing -- WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO- CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients. (a hoarse whisper) Are we there? 6. We’re there, Sunshine. TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open coffins. The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice. People, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience. The staff thanks you in advance. FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an impediment in weightlessness.

SCENE 7:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. SPACE77
Scene Action: Against the cold infinity of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE STAR. As it moves past like an endless train, we realize this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half a mile long. PAN WITH IT 180 to REVEAL -- A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face. The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.

SCENE 8:

Scene Name: EXT. PANDORA ORBIT88
Scene Action: ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora. CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive “VALKYRIE” SHUTTLES are mated to a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts. As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we-- 7.

SCENE 9:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHT99
Scene Action: FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding. The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES. Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to -- AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie- cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story buildings. And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --

Scene Name: EXT. HELL’S GATE - TWILIGHT1010
Scene Action: HELL’S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high, topped with razor wire. At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS swiveling on servo mounts. Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle, bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.

SCENE 11:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHT1111
Scene Action: Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block the view. A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound. REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching. INT/EXT. SHUTTLE1212 The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling -- Exopacks on! 8. Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced moves. Everybody except JAKE, who’s turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps. Remember people, you lose your mask you’re unconscious in 20 seconds and you’re dead in four minutes. Let’s nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report. The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark -- Exopack on, let’s go! BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear. INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks -- and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone else’s WAISTS. THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine. Go directly into the base! Do not stop! Go straight inside! HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex. Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops is the colony’s private security force. These guys are laid back, hardened, and haggard. Look at all that new meat. THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp. Check it out, man. Meals on wheels. That is just wrong. Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as -- 9. A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires -- ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and heavily armed, they are AT-99 “SCORPION” GUNSHIPS. MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4 meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90. Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high. A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege. WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches. What’re you two limpdicks starin’ at? As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and -- K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his head. A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT. WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL. It drops off the fence, tail still lashing. Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one. Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien. ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below. The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen’s claws raked across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars. 10. The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky. He eyes are an icy steel gray. HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds. You are not in Kansas any more...

SCENE 12:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT1313
Scene Action: THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell’s Gate colony. A hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide. Without his mask, we see that Quaritch’s features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very large PISTOL. ... You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day. JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back. COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline. Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees. The room gets very quiet. We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na’vi. They’re fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate -- we live -- at a constant threat condition yellow. PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers, engineers, geologists, as they take that in. 11. As head of security, it’s my job to keep you alive. I will not succeed -- (pausing for effect) -- not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure... PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues. Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.

Scene Name: INT. CORRIDOR1414
Scene Action: People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms, lugging duffels and cases. An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake. Hey, you’re Jake right? Tom’s brother? You look just like him. (off Jake’s wary look) Sorry, I’m Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him. Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it. He was a great guy -- funny. It was a big shock to all of us. Yeah. Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on. Norm walks with him. And duh! -- obviously you look like him. I mean, if you weren’t genetically identical, you wouldn’t be taking over his avatar. That’s why I’m here. 12. So -- you want to go check it out?

----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. BIO-LAB - DAY1515
Scene Action: JAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms. Me and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. They’re grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here. A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK. Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward -- THE AMNIO TANK.

Scene Name: INT. LINK ROOM - DUSK1616
Scene Action: 14. The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look like coffins crossed with MRI scanners. Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book -- I mean literally wrote the book -- on Pandoran botany. (low, over his shoulder) That's because she likes plants better than people. DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and cracking her neck after a long session. She’s fifty, with a strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes. (yelling) Who’s got my goddamn cigarette?! A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit. Around here they jump when Grace barks. Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach. And here she is, Cinderella back from the ball. Grace, I’d like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja -- Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi? (Na'vi, subtitled) May the All Mother smile upon our first meeting. Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette. (subtitled) Not bad. You sound a little formal. (subtitled) There is still much to learn. Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na’vi. 15. Uh, Grace, this is Jake S---- (turning to Jake) Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don’t need you. I need your brother. (to Max) You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission. He’s dead. I know it’s a big inconvenience to everyone. How much lab training have you had? Ever run a gas chromatograph? No. Any actual lab work at all? High school chemistry. But I ditched. Grace wheels on Max. You see? You see? They’re pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain. (turning away) I’m going to Selfridge. She shoves past Jake. Grace, that’s not a good idea. But she’s already out the door and clomping down the corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look. Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred. Try to use big words. 16.

Scene Name: INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK1717
Scene Action: It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex. ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless. He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as Grace strides toward him. Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see you’re intentionally screwing us. Grace. You know I enjoy our little talks. I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout. Selfridge looks down and hits the ball. Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past. Selfridge looks at her with a sigh. Actually, we got lucky with him. Lucky? How is this in any way lucky? As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball -- Well -- lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasn’t an oral hygienist or something. A Marine we can use. I’m assigning him to your team as security escort. The last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there! 17. Look, you’re supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives. Isn’t that the whole point of your little puppet show? If you look like them, if you talk like them, they’ll trust you? Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby. Grace follows. But after -- how many years? -- relations with the indigenous are only getting worse. That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them. On Selfridge’s desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid- air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK. Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of Grace’s eyes. This is why we’re here. Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. No other reason. This is what pays for the party. And it’s what pays for your science. Comprendo? He places it back in the magnetic field. Those savages are threatening our whole operation. We’re on the brink of war and you’re supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. So use what you’ve got and get me some results.

In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE’S AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM’S AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks. Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric sensors. How much link time have you logged? Five hundred and twenty hours. Grace looks pointedly at Jake. Like -- an hour. Tell me you’re joking. Grace opens the hood of Jake’s link unit. Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to help him but -- Don’t! I got this. Grace steps back, hands raised. He drags himself into the unit. So you just figured you’d come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head? He meets her eyes with a defiant glare. Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn’t do. Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand. Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL -- 19. Relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn’t be hard for you. Kiss the darkest part of my lily white -- But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest. Initiate link. The LINK TECH touches some controls.

Scene Action: Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area. Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about their daily activities around the compound. 21. Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful. He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn’t hear them -- he’s running. RUNNING! He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world. Hey Marine! Jake turns at the familiar voice to see -- A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach and firm athlete’s breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt. In human years she would be about 35. Grace? Well who’d you expect, numbnuts? Think fast! She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches. Motor control is looking good. Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin. Hey, check it out. Jake turns to see NORM’S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder -- chest shot, back shot, bi’s. I am a living god.

WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS three stories tall rip into the tree-line. One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel. The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a glimpse of glassy fangs before -- P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK. It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed rounds. The newbies stare at the thing’s barracuda teeth. For you pogues, this is a banshee. A small one. See, they like it when I bring fresh meat out here. And this clearcutting really stirs up the hornet’s nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If it moves, shoot it. If you’re not sure it’s moving -- shoot it! If it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT! What’re you gonna do? Shoot it, sir! 23. Outstanding. Let’s roll. Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush. As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver’s web. He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it into the mud as he moves on.

Yeah, ‘cause we’re not the only thing flyin’ around out there. Or the biggest. I’m gonna need you on a door gun, I’m a man short. Yeah, no problem. She extends her fist and he taps it with his. 25. See ya on the flight-line, zero nine. (she points) He’s down there. Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks. Techs clamber over the ‘suits, loading ordinance with cranes and lifts. At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area. QUARITCH is bench-pressing massive plates. This low gravity makes you soft. (pushing the last rep) You get soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning. Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded. I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela -- that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here, though. You got heart kid, coming out here. I figured -- just another hellhole. Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder. The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT -- That servo’s in, Colonel, if you want to try it. Quaritch crosses to the ‘suit, with Jake following. I was in First Recon a few years ahead of you. More than a few. Two tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here and -- He points to his scarred face. 26. They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what’s out there. Besides, I can’t leave -- He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree- line. This is my war, here. Quaritch climbs the ‘suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. The ‘suit’s gas-turbine spools up with a rising WHINE. The avatar program is a joke -- buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles’ camp. The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the ‘suit trembles with power. The air boils above the exhaust vents. Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic -- Looks good. (to Jake) I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit ‘em hard if they don’t. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or bagged-and-tagged. (nodding) That sounds real good, Colonel. So -- am I still with Augustine? On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for me? 27. Jake nods. Quaritch brings the ‘suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly. He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. He’s impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined. Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I’ll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. He raises the ‘suit’s hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!

Scene Action: FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY’S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape. ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun, scanning for aerial predators. In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes. Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids. TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a shallow river. Sturmbeest herd, one o’clock. Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-- A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river. Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles. The bull has the red on the dorsal armor? Grace nods approvingly. TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS. TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like it’s a gun-run. Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he’s about to puke. 30. Yo Chacon! Get some! Jake grins into the airstream.

WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe. Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots. JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters. He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS called HELICORADIANS. He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish. Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another -- like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK! SHTOONK! A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground, REVEALING -- A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark. Its baleful eyes lock onto him. Jake raises his rifle. Grace, alerted by the creature’s SNORTS, runs to where she can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE. Don’t shoot. You’ll piss it off. The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide sledgehammer of a skull. It’s already pissed off! Jake, that armor’s too thick. Trust me. Jake starts to back away. The hammerhead bellows again, pawing the earth. It’s a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he’ll charge. 34. What do I do? Hold your ground! The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES -- Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing. It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT. ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked. Oh yeah! Who’s bad?! That’s right. SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus -- A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the Alien for desert. It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws. JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead -- That’s what I’m talkin’ about, bitch! The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away through splintering undergrowth. That’s right motherf-- A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see -- THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes. The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS. What about this one? Run, don’t run? What? 35. Run. Definitely RUN! Jake BOLTS as -- The thanator LEAPS after him and -- Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while -- Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and -- SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off a trunk as -- JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but -- JAKE dives under a massive root system, and -- CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he rolls and crawls -- Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying. It’s spittle sprays across Jake, jaws inches away as -- He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK away. Jake scrambles to escape but -- GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and -- The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit, only -- It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and -- He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but -- With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him, splintering trees. JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and -- He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might -- The thanator’s jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies out into open space and -- 36. JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river. The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon. Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past his face amid turbulent bubbles. A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and -- Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.

SCENE 37:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT3939
Scene Action: LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the black trees. Jake’s got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by a pack of VIPERWOLVES. Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking black movement -- then nothing. Darkness. TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake’s hands as he knots his T-shirt around the butt end of the spear. ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it. A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch. The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing, leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the trail. Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES. Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid. He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead. Another on his opposite flank. Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH. The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey. They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees. JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it on a horizontal trunk -- -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The viperwolves have him encircled. 39. The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on his legs from behind but -- JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face. It yips and goes past, but ANOTHER moves in -- He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS, retreating, baring its fangs. Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees what he’s up against. The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS. Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums. Jake realizes that he is making his final stand. He whirls the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay -- And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone. (screaming) I don’t have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on! With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK. Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as -- ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking true, but -- Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as-- A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which -- CUTS deep into the beast’s shoulder and it lets go. JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as -- THREE WOLVES charge at once. The nearest LEAPS at his throat just as -- THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest. The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight. He pushes it off in time to see -- 40. A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another wolf falls. NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf. ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand. Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest. SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away, but -- It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face. MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves. Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!! The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and-- They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them- - Raaaarrrr! Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it and looks up at -- NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is over, she turns. She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him. Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream. Wait, don’t -- Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest is transformed. The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light. 41. Jake scrambles to recover his spear. Neytiri kneels beside -- A DYING WOLF. It’s CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air, trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its chest. (in Na’vi) Forgive me, my brother. She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches its head gently, regarding it with sadness. Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling the arrow from its heart. Look, um, I know you probably don’t understand this. But -- thanks. Thank you. I owe you. Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal. (in Na’vi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother. I would have been screwed if you hadn’t come along -- She rises and walks away without looking at Jake. Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin’? He crashes through some plants, catching up to her. Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those -- He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and -- WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat. He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English. 42. Don’t thank! You don’t thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only. Okay, I’m sorry. Whatever I did -- I’m sorry. She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves. All this is your fault! They did not need to die. They attacked me. How’m I the bad guy here-- She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat. Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, don’t know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only. Jake gets up, slowly, facing her. Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What’s the thinking? CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs. Why save you? Yes, why save me? You have a strong heart. No fear. She leans closer -- But stupid! Ignorant like a child! She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her. 43. TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT. WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway. Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST. If I’m so ignorant, maybe you should teach me. Sky people can not learn. You do not See. She leaps to another elevated root. Jake follows, surprised that he made it. Whooaa. He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace. Then teach me to “see.” She stops and he almost runs into her. No one can teach you to See. Then she turns and trots on.

SCENE 38:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. GORGE - NIGHT4040
Scene Action: They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a horizontal trunk big as an oak. WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers. Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and -- Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height. 44. --you just have to get to know me. I’m Jake. Jake Sull-- A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance. He drops the spear and almost falls off the root. Whooaaa -- shit! Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river. She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na’vi. I need your help. You should not be here. So take me with you. No. You go back. DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently toward Jake and Neytiri. NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see -- The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head. (off her amazed look) What? More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him. Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow he’s not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body. What are they? CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread. Atokirina’. Seeds of the Great Tree -- very pure spirits. 45. Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT -- moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until -- -- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering into the darkness. What was that all about? Neytiri seems shaken. She seizes his hand and pulls him after her. Come!

SCENE 39:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT4141
Scene Action: TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder. He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them. Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch down. Dream-like, surreal beauty. WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror- like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL. Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk. What’s your name? JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at him, spinning end for end and -- SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs. He topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below. JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as -- SEVERAL NA’VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales. 46. We see that the riders’ QUEUES are connected to the horses’ long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons. The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake turns to bolt, but -- NA’VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed -- blocking his retreat. Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na’vi -- (subtitled) Tsu’tey, what are you doing?! He is my captive! TSU’TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings off his mount with fluid grace. TSU’TEY (subtitled) These demons are forbidden here. I will kill this one as a lesson to the others! Tsu’tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake, confronting him warrior to warrior. (subtitled) Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik. Tsu’tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS. TSU’TEY (subtitled) Bring him. They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu’tey and the others ride ahead.

SCENE 41:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT4343
Scene Action: An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe -- mothers with babies, old women, young hunters. They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow him. Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery -- a living cathedral. Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting. The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM. Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is -- EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS. His normally stern features are clouded further by anger. (subtitled) Why do you bring this creature here? Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na’vi. (subtitled) I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa. He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake. (subtitled) 48. I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! His alien smell fills my nose Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not submissive tone. (subtitled) Father, many atokirina came to this alien. What’s going on? My father is deciding whether to kill you. Your father!? (to Eytukan) Uh, good to meet you, sir. Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as -- A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber. MO’AT (Na’vi) Step back! Everybody looks up. MO’AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down. She is a severe woman in her 50’s. Her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH. MO’AT (subtitled) I will look at this alien. There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase. That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one who interprets the will of Eywa. 49. Who’s Eywa? Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo’at passes. The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue. MO’AT (thick accent) What are you called? Jake Sully. She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a flourish she strikes his chest. Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. She tastes it. Why did you come to us? I came to learn. We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I’m no scientist. What are you? I don’t know. I was a Marine -- uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan. TSU’TEY (subtitled) A warrior! I could kill him easily! (subtitled) No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him. 50. What’s going on? What are they saying? MO’AT (to Neytiri, subtitled) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do. NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry. (subtitled) Why me? That's not fair! I only-- MO’AT (subtitled) It is decided! Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake. (to Jake) My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured. She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern -- (subtitled) He is your responsibility. Neytiri nods, accepting, but she’s not a happy camper. She grabs Jake’s arm and pulls him roughly away. So it’s all good, right? You and me -- Do not speak.

Complete Content: An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe -- mothers with babies, old women, young hunters. They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow him. Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery -- a living cathedral. Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting. The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM. Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is -- EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS. His normally stern features are clouded further by anger. (subtitled) Why do you bring this creature here? Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na’vi. (subtitled) I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa. He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake. (subtitled) 48. I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! His alien smell fills my nose Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not submissive tone. (subtitled) Father, many atokirina came to this alien. What’s going on? My father is deciding whether to kill you. Your father!? (to Eytukan) Uh, good to meet you, sir. Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as -- A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber. MO’AT (Na’vi) Step back! Everybody looks up. MO’AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down. She is a severe woman in her 50’s. Her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH. MO’AT (subtitled) I will look at this alien. There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase. That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one who interprets the will of Eywa. 49. Who’s Eywa? Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo’at passes. The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue. MO’AT (thick accent) What are you called? Jake Sully. She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a flourish she strikes his chest. Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. She tastes it. Why did you come to us? I came to learn. We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine.

Scene Action: LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL. He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound with plant-fiber bandages. 51. THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the circle. Don’t get up. Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY. You never told me your name. Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at’ite. Okay, again, a whole lot slower. (exaggerated slowness) Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree. Jake knows she’s baiting him. He smiles in response. Nay-TEE-ree. That’s nice. Nay-TEE- ree. ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu’tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together, glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger. TSU’TEY (subtitled) These aliens try to look like people, but they can’t. (subtitled) He seems dim to me. And his eyes are too small. NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving leaves onto his own leaf. Your mom likes me. I can tell. MO’AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan. (subtitled) 52. Neytiri will test this “warrior.” Hey may learn nothing -- but we will learn much. You speak truth. We must understand these Sky People if we are to drive them out. Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing. These rock. What are they? Teylu. You call beetle larvae. Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and starts munching enthusiastically. That’s some damn fine teylu. That’s like grandma’s teylu. CU TSU’TEY, warily eyeing Jake -- TSU’TEY (subtitled) I say she will kill him.

We try to give them medicine and education. Roads! But no -- they like mud. I wouldn’t care except -- Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A road runs from Hell’s Gate to a proposed new mine miles away. Their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction. Which sucks -- for them -- because they need to relocate. (taking that in) Does Augustine know about this? Yeah, she does, and she’s on the next ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it. So -- who talks them into moving? (turning) 55. Guess. What if they won’t go? (icy) I’m betting they will. Killing the indigenous looks bad, but there’s one thing shareholders hate more than bad press -- and that’s a bad quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to get them to move, or it’s going to have to be all stick. Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility. You got three months. That’s when the dozers get there.

As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around her workstation. CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls, a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her. Jake, take number two, it’s the least glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate Jake’s link. Norm glares at Jake as he passes. Hey. You got a problem? Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over. I trained three years for this mission. I speak the language fluently. (he points at Jake) He falls off the frickin’ turnip truck and all of a sudden he’s cultural ambassador!? It’s not our choice, Norm. He glowers at Jake. Yeah, well I didn’t come out here to wash the dishes while you’re on some interspecies booty call. He stalks off. He can’t go far. She points to Jake’s link. Let’s get you in. 63. INT/EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE5959 LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the ground. Villagers are ant-like. Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto -- A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest. NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND. Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight. A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a Na’vi with a 10 meter wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her. Holy shit. Do not look in her eye. Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK. It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer. Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the Banshee’s ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made. Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life. She climbs smoothly onto the animal’s back. To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must choose your own ikran. And he must choose you. 64. When? When you are ready. The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation. Heeyaaahh! Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a power climb. Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks. ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her.

SCENE 57:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXT6060
Scene Action: STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the camera. He looks tired. Do I have to do this? I need some rack. GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling. No -- now, when it’s fresh. Yeah, yeah. (to camera) The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it’s like field- stripping a weapon. Repetition. JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips. Seyri. 65. She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence. Ontu, mikyun, nari. NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow. BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly. Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard. HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see -- TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm’s bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads. Norm’s attitude has improved lately. NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. Thank you? Ireiyo. Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation. Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo. You’ve gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it. Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated. It’s good he’s back on board, but he thinks I’m a retard too. TRACKING WITH JAKE’S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark. My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day. Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground. 66. He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up. She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey. I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die. Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until -- She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush. He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive. Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed. That he lived. TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school. IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO’AT. The Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows. Grace’s eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na’vi. I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning. Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting. (Na’vi, subtitled) I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite. I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine. ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air. 67. I’m learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds. JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as -- A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs. One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau. ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are closed. She speaks very softly to Jake -- When you hear nothing, you will hear everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything. Sometimes I have no idea what she’s talking about. Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature. Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery. It’s been a month and I’m still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn’t given permission. NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth. She points and he parts some leaves to see -- A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs. She licks their faces. There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens. He’s changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale. 68. (smirking) I just hope this treehugger shit isn’t on the final. Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples. (without looking up) This isn’t just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes. Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay? NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits. CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources. NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool. A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow. ZAP! Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly. ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. Aware of her touch, Jake’s focus is broken. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly. NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns. Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond. As he approaches -- SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing. Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight. 69. Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying. And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him. INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake’s eyes open in the darkness. He doesn’t know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light. Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream. TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies. JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife. He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na’vi. (Na’vi) I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. NEYTIRI watches with approval. A clean kill. You are ready.

----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. SHACK - NIGHT6161
Scene Action: Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin. Norm helps Grace get him to his chair. You’re still losing weight. Here -- She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien food. Bites into it without enthusiasm. I made a kill today. We ate it. I know where that meal came from. 70. Other body. You need to take care of this body. Yeah yeah. Jake, I’m serious -- you look like crap. You’re burning too hard. Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out. Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me. I’m telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time. Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee. Yeah -- you’re gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying. That’s right, Grace. This is what I’ve been working for. And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. You’re getting in way too deep. (she turns away) Trust me, I learned the hard way. Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace’s workstation. What did happen at the school? GRACE looks up from making coffee. Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children. Finally -- 71. Neytiri’s sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting. GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste. One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they’d set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them. GRACE’S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator. The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse. MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING. They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the others. (mildly) I got most of the kids out, before they shot me. Jesus. Yeah. Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it. A scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa’atenuk. Mother. (turning to him) That kind of pain reaches back through the link. GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake. It’s a job. Learn what you can -- but don’t get attached. 72. GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes. It’s not our world, Jake. And we can’t stop what’s coming.

Scene Name: EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY6262
Scene Action: TSU’TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who’s riding well enough to keep up. The horses’ hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon. Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. It’s the test every young hunter has to pass. TSU’TEY signals a stop. UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip. A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds. There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at -- One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky. The Hunters dismount. JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He turns to Tsu’tey, who is checking the young hunters’ gear. We doin’ this? Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu’tey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk.

Scene Action: 73. 200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree. JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward. They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them. Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss. One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass. Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands above.

A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD. It waits, docile, as -- She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu’tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And Jake sees -- The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out- croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges. 74. TSU’TEY Jakesully will go first. Tsu’tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough. Tsu’tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge. (whispering) Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel -- inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance. How will I know if he chooses me? He will try to kill you. Outstanding. Out of sight of Tsu’tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn’t happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with -- The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display. Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO. A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares straight at him. Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it. Let’s dance. The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as- - Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee’s jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT. Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but -- 75. Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head. Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his queue but -- The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and -- IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as -- NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu’tey laughs and yells mockingly. The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but -- Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and -- Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and -- The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting. They are locked together, literally eye to eye. That’s right! You’re mine. ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well. Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creature’s back. Neytiri runs to him. First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait. Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power. He grips a hank of the beast’s main, and -- Heeeyyyaaaah! THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and -- 76. They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so much he can't think. Shut the hell up!! It does. Level out! Fly straight! It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking “bank left” and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath. NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE falls into formation with him. She signals “follow me” and DIVES. Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri’s banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake’s wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky. THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning. They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines. Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight. Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal’s back. He’s reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT. Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy. INT/EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS - DAY6666 NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight principles like one fighter pilot to another. LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and soaring into a series of aerobatic turns. 77. I may not be much of a horse guy. But I was born to do this. THEY FLY in close formation with TSU’TEY and the young HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist. ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world. She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He DIVES after her. IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE’S BANSHEE snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back. He’s teaching it to take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head. TSU’TEY is nearby with the young hunters. He eyes Jake with frustrated hostility. ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily. She points and Jake sees -- A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.

Scene Name: EXT. RIDGE6767

A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning. Jake looks up to see -- A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him. Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying. The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as -- K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following him down, both diving like missiles and -- 78. JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between two huge branches -- Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings. It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy. CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The lord of its domain. ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na’vi equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.

Scene Name: INT. SHACK - NIGHT6868
Scene Action: Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation-- science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are crowded around as well. The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator. Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported. Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb. There usually isn’t time to key the mike. The People call it Toruk. (translating) Last Shadow. Last one you ever see. I saw one take out a gunship once - - WHAM! Total frickin’ yard sale. Ate the crew like peanuts. 79. TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched formation. That’s it. Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls. It’s their most sacred place. She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior. Something big is going on in there, biologically. I’d die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly forbidden. TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up. As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace’s images of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip. They’re coming back. Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is doing. If you don’t give him something, he’s gonna shut us down. He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock. Hey, guys.

TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down, flipping twice from momentum. JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the plexus between the armored shoulders and -- THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud of dust. NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning wolfishly. CU TSU’TEY, banking around Jake’s kill. Jake looks up, and Tsu’tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.

Scene Name: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT7171
Scene Action: 81. The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant is passed around. NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT. NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail. JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It seems to watch Jake. TSU’TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face. Jake braces himself -- and Tsu’tey holds up the KAVA BOWL, offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch? Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm. Watch that stuff. It’ll knock you into next week. Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu’tey. They lock eyes. Tsu’tey drinks. LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire. WIDER ON JAKE and TSU’TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. Tsu’tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS. TSU’TEY I thought -- enough drink -- you would not be so ugly. Sorry. Tsu’tey looks deep into the fire. TSU’TEY Your warriors -- hide inside machines -- fight from far away. (he looks at Jake) I did not think a sky person could be brave. 82. Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI’S lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up -- You must dance! It is the way. TSU’TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening -- the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger. The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of dancers. Jake takes Grace’s hand and pulls her up, protesting. JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy. GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her. Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other. A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN follow their look, seeing the obvious connection. MO’AT (subtitled) We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsu’tey. ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with Neytiri.

UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral. It’s hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest. 83. HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly sensuous image. They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed-- MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops. A blue hand picks the flower. -- and one day you have to give it back. LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads. Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body. Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO -- JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard. Hard to believe it’s only been three months. JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He looks like a junkie watching a test pattern. (to the lens) I can barely remember my old life. I’m not sure who I am anymore.

Good of you to stop by. How’s it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet? Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form. See, I keep hooking it. It’s the damn pack. THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads 220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it. The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so -- You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not? Go ahead. Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But -- we need more time. Not what I was hoping to hear. It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open. Parker, it’s their ancestral home. They’ve lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks. This thing is inevitable. What does it matter when it happens? I’m sorry, Dr. Augustine. You’re out of time. He leaves them standing there to get drenched.

Scene Name: INT. ARMOR BAY7474
Scene Action: 85. A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake. He studies Jake’s pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard. You’re not gettin’ lost in the woods, are you son? Jake can’t meet his eyes. Your last report was two weeks ago. I’m starting to doubt your resolve. From what I see, it’s time to terminate this mission. Jake eyes flare with alarm. No. I can do this. Look, you’ve given me plenty of usable intel. Like this “Well of Souls” place -- I’ve got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it will. Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he’s done. So you’ll get your legs back, like I promised. (puts his hand on Jake’s shoulder) It’s time to come in. Jake ponders this. Isn’t this what he was doing all this for? I’ve gotta finish this thing. There’s one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It’s the final stage of becoming a man. Then I’m one of them. They’ll trust what I say... It’s hard for him to even form these words -- ... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation. 86. Then you need to get it done, Corporal.

Scene Name: INT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHT7676
Scene Action: Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously. Jake, I can’t allow this. You’re just not strong enough. It’s the last door -- I’m going through it. You can help me or get out of the way. Jake pushes past her toward the corridor -- (grabbing him) Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na’vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death. And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-- we have no idea what that’ll do in an avatar brain. Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor. GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside. Norm is initializing the Link. Calibrating. Thirty seconds. She puts her hands on his shoulders. 87. No matter what you prove out there- - you are still in here. (shaking him) Right here. I have to go all the way -- become one of them-- (furiously) Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them! Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE’ voice. Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. You visit -- and you leave. During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside. (softening) You can never truly be with her. Jake stops, pinioned by the truth. He seems suddenly very lost. You know why I’m here? Because Quaritch sent me. What? That’s right -- to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn’t care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it. Norm is in shock. But Grace is eerily calm. And what about now, Jake? I’m not that guy any more. 88. Grace nods. She’s been on his journey every step of the way. I know. But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out -- I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that’s if they don’t cut my heart out and show it to me. Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them. In his own perfect Hell. They won’t understand what you’ve done. They don’t even have a word for “lie” -- they had to learn it from us. Grace sees he is on the verge of tears. Lost and alone, between worlds. I know. I taught it to them. (pleading) Grace. I’ve gotta go. They’re waiting. Link is ready. Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid. Jake. You can’t carry this burden much longer. (smiling wanly) It’s okay. Mo’at says an alien mind probably can’t survive the Dream Hunt anyway. Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night. 89. (to Norm) Prep my link. I’m going in.

Scene Name: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT7777
Scene Action: JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the Dream Hunt. When your Spirit Animal comes, you will know. Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer. TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to HOMETREE’S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter. BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM. TIME CUT -- MO’AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms. MACRO - MO’AT’S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood. (subtitled) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision. MO’AT places the worm on Jake’s out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does. MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion. He places it against the back of Jake’s neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake’s skin and -- Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle. 90. Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant. SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening. Jake looks down at the palms of his hands. JAKE’S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground and -- INSTANTLY the circle of Na’vi recedes, as if to a distant horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS. ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and -- The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance. Jake looks down -- JAKE’S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and -- CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but -- IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW. CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which FILLS THE UNIVERSE and -- REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his head, while inside -- TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the wind of time blowing through him as -- REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -- INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora -- --but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow. 91. Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and -- PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and -- SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room. It is finished. Neytiri’s face is flooded with relief. The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. (subtitled) Did your Spirit Animal come? Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu’tey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? Mo’at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul. (to Jake) Something has come. (to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear. She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly. OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed. Eytukan places both hands on Jake’s chest and holds them there. (subtitled) You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You are part of the People. All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake’s shoulders, back, chest -- 92. hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.

Scene Name: EXT. WILLOW GLADE7979
Scene Action: Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. It is an exquisitely beautiful spot. The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her. This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Na’vi VOICES. It’s like -- a sound you feel. 93. We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa. A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous. He feels drawn into them. But she pulls back a little. You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. (she looks away) And you may choose a woman. The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual. Jake suppresses a smile. We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer -- I don’t want Ninat. There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter -- Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her. I’ve already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving gently over each other. She already has. He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other. Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling. Kissing is very good. But we have something better. 94. She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss. Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined. MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle undulations. JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. The ultimate intimacy. They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them. THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO -- LATER. She is collapsed across his chest. Spent. He strokes her face tenderly. Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping. She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest -- This body is real. (she touches his forehead) This spirit is real. Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep. When I was first your teacher, I hated all Sky People. But you have also taught me. (whispering) Spirit is all that matters. She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for life. We are? 95. Yes. It is our way. (innocently) Oh. I forgot to tell? He rouses up, making her look at him. Really, we are? We are. Jake considers this. It’s cool. I’m there. He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps.

ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable. (to Selfridge) What do we do? Roll on. He’ll move. These people have to learn that we don’t stop. TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward. ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.

SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH watch with disdain. You let me down, son. You got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for. Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare. Parker, listen, there may still be time to -- Shut your fucking hole! 104. Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch’s fury. But she meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch. Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog! Can we just take this down a couple notches, please. (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. Jake nods to Grace to continue. (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can’t imagine. You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern. I’m not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I’m talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest. (frustrated) Which is what exactly? Grace’s nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor. (to Jake) I can’t do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate? 105. Just tell him what you know in your heart. She turns to Parker, steeling herself. Alright, look -- I don’t have the answers yet, I’m just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there’s some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora -- That’s a lot I’m guessing. That’s more connections than the human brain. You get it? It’s a network -- a global network. And the Na’vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed. What the hell have you people been smoking out there? They’re just. Goddamn. Trees. You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isn’t in the ground -- it’s all around us. The Na’vi know that, and they’re fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. We understand them just fine. Thanks to Jake here. Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a NEW CLIP on the main monitor -- TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue. 106. They’re not going to give up their home -- they’re not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There’s nothing we have that they want. We’re a horror to them. We’re the monsters from space. JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love. They’re never going to leave Hometree. Quaritch FREEZES the recording. Since a deal can’t be made -- it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. I’m getting all emotional. I might just give you a big wet kiss. Parker, we have to talk, like rational people. Well, I’d cherish that, but unfortunately you’re out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I’m shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now. ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless. A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW MOTION, spears and bows held high.

The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon. A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd. (subtitled) You have to leave, or you will die. Are you certain of this? They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it. 110. What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen? He is unable to meet her eyes. Yes. (anguished) At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love- - with the forest, with the Omaticaya People -- (he looks at her) -- with you. And by then, how could I tell you? Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain -- I trusted you, Jake! Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to - - You will never be one of the People! NEVER! TSU’TEY yells to his HUNTERS -- (subtitled) Bind them. They grab Jake, who doesn’t resist. Others seize Grace. Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound.

SCENE 104:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. HOMETREE109109
Scene Action: JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to Hometree. The People look up as -- THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees. The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of flying leaves and debris. IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen -- a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts. Well, I’d say diplomacy has failed. TSU’TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships. I think they mean to cut their throats if we don’t back off. Make sure you get a nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto the after- action report. JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu’tey, the others gathered nearby -- You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, I’m begging you! EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU’TEY and yells -- (subtitled) Take the ikran! Attack from above! Tsu’tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree. IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient. Alright, let’s get this done. Give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door. Roger. CS forties. Going hot. Fire. 112. On the Dragon’s stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and -- K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS. THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to cough and gag. Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the gunships with their longbows. IN THE DRAGON’S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK against the armored windows. AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse. (yelling/subtitled) Everybody outside! Go to the Forest. The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling. Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas. JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings. KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons. FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree. INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside, coughing and dragging wounded with them. High up in the trunk, TSU’TEY and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball. OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts. Out of the smoke, MO’AT appears in front of Jake. She raises a KNIFE and -- SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with horror, but also something else. Call it faith. MO’AT You are one of us. Help us! Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free. 113. We’ve gotta move! He’s gonna blow the columns. As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN. Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion. IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches. That’s how you scatter the roaches. Okay, switch missiles. Give me H- E’s at the base of the west columns. Copy, switching missiles. IN TRUDY’S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging Quaritch’s order. Screw it. She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her aircraft out of formation. PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his glasses. Bring it down. MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships and -- The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and -- The Omaticaya watch in horror as -- HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE. In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness. AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU’TEY and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES. It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY. 114. HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris. IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction. Nice work people. Alright, let’s light it up. INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts of FIRE in the debris of Hometree. THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire- storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances. JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks. Neytiri! Neytiri! GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away from the fire-storm. NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the INFERNO. She sees -- EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him. (subtitled) Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the People. In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands. She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief. JAKE reels out of the smoke. Kneels next to her. I’m sorry -- She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears stream down her face. Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come back! Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father’s body. Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as -- 115. NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her stomach. Keening like an animal. SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant. I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up...

Jake looks up as -- HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse.

Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules. DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen. Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell. JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around him. A SCREECH. Jake looks up as -- HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse. Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. Come on, boy. Time to fly.

Scene Action: THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him. It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head cocking left, then right. The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake’s banshee falls across the back of the mighty Toruk. But that was just a theory. JAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our own shadow then -- 123.

Scene Name: EXT. WELL OF SOULS - LATE AFTERNOON127127
Scene Action: The Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance. CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE. She looks up, and her eyes go wide as -- A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward. AN ENORMOUS SHADOW covers the crowd as -- TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within. The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. And that’s when they see -- JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed Na’vi. Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animal’s flank. NEYTIRI, TSU’TEY and MO’AT watch in stunned amazement as the legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them. (breathing the words) Toruk Macto. Neytiri raises her arms. (shouting) Toruk Macto! ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya -- new hope dawning in their eyes. WHISPERS flow among them, the words REPEATED -- Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto... Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the emotion between them is powerful and pure. I See you. 124. (a hoarse whisper) I See you. Neytiri’s eyes brim with tears. I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I’m not any more. Jake takes Neytiri’s hand and climbs the steps of the dais. MO’AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to Tsu’tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension. Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says -- (subtitled) Tsu’tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People. (then just for Tsu’tey) You are Olo’eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can’t do this without you. Tsu’tey struggles with his emotions. Finally -- TSU’TEY I will fly with you. Ireiyo. JAKE turns to the MATRIARCH. Grace is dying. I beg the help of the Great Mother. Bring her, Jakesully. TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace’s HUMAN BODY, lightly in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE’S AVATAR. Look where we are, Grace. Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother Tree. 125. (with a wan smile) I need to take some samples. Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the altar-rock. Mo’at touches Jake’s shoulder and he steps back. MO’AT (quietly) The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is -- Mo’at’s hand indicates Grace’s AVATAR -- MO’AT -- in this body. CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she’s saying. Is that possible? MO’AT Possible, yes. She must pass through the Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully-- she is very weak. Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his avatar hand. Hang on, they’re gonna fix you up. Grace is barely conscious. She grips his hand. I -- always held back. But you gave them your heart. I’m proud of you, Jake. Jake feels his throat close with emotion. Grace’s eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint. Help them. You do whatever it takes. You hear me? I will. 126. TIME CUT -- MO’AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the tendrils of the Mother Tree. NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums. MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the roots and are gently spreading over Grace’s HUMAN skin. JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to the root-floor by a thousand connections. GRACE’S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT- CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body. The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO’AT, on her knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE. GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED, as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be explained. ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake’s convulsively, as she tries to anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds -- I’m with her Jake -- (an amazed whisper) -- she’s real -- Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps through the silken white root-cilia growing across her abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON. She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL. Grace! He sees the roots falling away from her human body. JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT. MO’AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with him, touching his shoulder. MO’AT Her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. She is with Eywa now. 127. NEYTIRI removes Grace’s mask and gently closes her eyes. Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together. NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope conflicting on her face -- -- and he raises his head. TURNS to face TSU’TEY and the With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating. Tsu’tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together. JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace’s death in the passion and fury of his voice. Tsu’tey TRANSLATES beside him. The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land! TSU’TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest. JAKE takes Neytiri’s hand and runs to the leonopteryx. He vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him. THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake’s leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it. LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different directions.

QUARITCH stands in front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing. People, you are fighting for survival. There’s an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide. 129. The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls. It looks like Woodstock in the jungle. These orbital images show the hostiles’ numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then they’ll be overrunning our perimeter here. We can’t wait. Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror. TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers. Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes. Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won’t come within a thousand klicks of this place.

That puts all on-world assets under my command. You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call -- Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an ampsuit. You’re a long way from Earth. Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him? Quaritch releases him and walks away. (to his men) Get him out of here. Several troopers converge on Selfridge. You touch me you’re so fired. He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door.

(to Max) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way. No, Quaritch has taken over. He’s rolling and there’s no stopping him. When? Oh six hundred tomorrow. Jake takes that in. Thanks. Max signs off. We’re screwed. You know he’s gonna commit those bombers straight to the Well of Souls. That’s right. Because I gave it to him on a plate. We both did. 132. If he takes out the Well of Souls - - it’s over. It’s their main line to Eywa, to their ancestors -- it’ll destroy them. Then I guess we better stop him. Jake looks like he’s about to collapse. He’s gaunt, eyes deeply shadowed, hands shaking. You need to get some rack.

He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with the hunters, talking about what they’ve learned. (low) You know our chances suck. Yeah. Going up against gunships with bows and arrows... What’s your point? (nodding) Right. She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON.

He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC. The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the world. Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward him, moving in a breeze that isn’t there. I’ve never done this in my life. He squats at the base of the tree. And I’m probably just talking to a tree right now. But if you’re there -- I need to give you a heads up. He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate softly. It’s easy to imagine a presence. 134. If Grace is there with you -- look in her memories -- she can show you the world we come from. There’s no green there. They killed their Mother, and they’re gonna do the same thing here. FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down. WOODSPRITES float in silence, moving around aimlessly. More Sky People are gonna come. They’re gonna come like a rain that never ends -- Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening. -- until they’ve covered the world. Unless we stop them. Look, you chose me for somethin’. And I’ll stand and fight, you know I will. But I could use a little help here. Jake senses Neytiri and turns. Our Great Mother does not take sides. She protects only the balance of life. She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his. It was worth a try. They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together. Holding each other -- in this, the last moment of peace. TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE carries over -- MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship stub-wings. 135. TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows. Stringing bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses. TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps. LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor wash.

PILOTS close gunship canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps. LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor wash.

Scene Name: EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN137137
Scene Action: THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing -- the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops, while the gunships hover protectively. THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets. They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons leveled, advancing in a cordon. UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables. Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward, leading the army into the forest. LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display -- ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES. 136. Contact. Two hundred meters. A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating WAR CRIES of untold Na’vi. The troopers, look around, spooked. They can’t tell where the sound is coming from. Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING. They grip their weapons, bracing themselves as -- THREE HUNDRED NA’VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an awesome sight. NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na’vi hunters, carrying an assault rifle. THE NA’VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line. The hunters raise their bows as -- THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90’s. ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders. Fire for effect. The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the jungle, blasting foliage into confetti. CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as -- RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto. TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down. NORM’S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as -- A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit’s canopy but -- THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse. Riders pivot their mounts to flee and -- THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders scattering. 137. LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at moving targets. OVERHEAD, NA’VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running along the branches. As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA’VI open fire and -- TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets Jake taught them, but -- THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS. TRACERS rip through the foliage and -- NA’VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet. NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his HANDSET -- Jake! Jake! We’re falling back! SURVIVING NA’VI flee the horrific onslaught. It is a total rout. IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures streaming through the forest below. Blue team, switch forties. Fire at will. Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts. Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle -- STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na’vi leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught. HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The downblast of the VALKYRIE’S lift jets shreds the forest. INSIDE THE SHUTTLE’S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp. THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and -- BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions. 138. AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na’vi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves. IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five. Yeah baby! Get some! GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR’s and GAU- 90’s.

SCENE 133:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL138138
Scene Action: Quaritch’s fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of Truth. Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red team, with me. We’re punching for the main target. Quaritch glances up to see -- A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey. CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as he leads the charge and -- SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined. JAKE’S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X shape just before -- K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE can barely hang onto the gyrating creature. The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy. Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees. There is a satisfying FIREBALL. SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, FIRING cannons and rockets. JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion. JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and -- 139. The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees. DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like Messerschmidts from a B-17 as -- WE FOLLOW TSU’TEY’S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops in from its blind spot and -- THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu’tey flashes past them, SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy. A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to- air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION. WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor. IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire -- tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the stub-wing pods. NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her. A Scorpion is right on her ass as -- SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling vines but -- THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and tracers FLASH toward us as -- SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but -- HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving. The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the shock wave. THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot rolled up on their sides and -- THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but - - A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and -- 140. K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws and teeth as they fall together out of control. Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick, breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING. FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it. This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a breathing mask. The door gunners wave at -- TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship with BURSTS from an AR in her lap. The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control. You’re not the only ones with guns, you pricks. NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the trees, under the canopy. They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle. THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse of blue-skinned figures. THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and -- The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor. KABOOM!! NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a broken kite, crashing down through branches and -- SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned. IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS. He taps the pilot and points -- There it is. (into his headset) 141. Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is in sight. IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their deadly loads. Target in sight. CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu’tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to him by AIRCOM HEADSET. We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes. TSU’TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but -- A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as -- TSU’TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships. GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort. TSU’TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and -- WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and -- A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured. NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s rip the forest to shreds. Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar body mortally wounded as -- HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another magazine, panting in fear and pain as -- AN AMPSUIT stomps up. Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!

Scene Name: EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL148148
Scene Action: JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures. THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na’vi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers. HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in. They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage. The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear. JAKE’S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttle’s broad back as -- GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them with his AR, still running forward and -- JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of the VTOL turbofans as -- HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and -- HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and -- 146. JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle. ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping. Mains to a hundred percent! Get me airspeed! The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and -- The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward. It still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until -- IT’S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and -- THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose. We’re good! BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na’vi hunter runs forward and -- THOONK! ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots’ necks and chests. THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest. ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the wreckage falling. Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any of ya’ll want to get off this piece of shit planet, you better cover our ass, ‘cause we’re the only way back to orbit. Roger that. FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank away, with most of the remaining gunships following. Get back here you worthless pukes! Are we breaking off? Quaritch draws his pistol. 147. What do you think? He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now. Only death.

Scene Action: JAKE’S LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig 29. He pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls backward off his mount and -- JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon.

THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with a ROAR of protesting rotors and -- JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against a cowling and -- JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as -- K-BLAM! The grenade blows a two meter hole in the hull -- WHOOOSHH! Pandoran air swirls inside. (to the pilot) Put your mask on. Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as -- JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over open space. HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL. K-WHAM! K-WHAM! Rounds clang next to Jake’s head. He LETS GO, plummeting into the trees -- Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF, as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall -- 149. HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and then another, and -- WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur. Jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.

SHE BANKS hard, pulling g’s, coming around on the Dragon. She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight at the WARSHIP. QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage. IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run -- No!

Scene Name: EXT. LAKE157157
Scene Action: THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning. 151. He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. QUARITCH’S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle. He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK. INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing. QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button-- WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him. Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor. THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but -- NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the ‘suit’s hand but -- Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri. CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the ‘suit’s KNIFE and -- QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator’s chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped. Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant. It’s all over Quaritch -- Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The ‘suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun. Nothing’s over while I’m breathing. Kinda hoped you’d say that. 152. QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as -- Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and -- K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and -- SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying. QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before -- THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and -- JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but -- INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and -- FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake’s link sits just inside. INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -- P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE. NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake. How does it feel to betray your own race? Then, inexplicably, he TURNS. Walks away. 153. FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and -- CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. He is reaching inside for the Link when -- JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and -- JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch’s shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but -- QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground. INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK. NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out. THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -- JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as -- THE KNIFE reaches his throat as -- THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch’s chest. He looks up. NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly. TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still. QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies. NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her father’s bow. JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --

They’re safe. Tsu’tey weakly clutches his severed queue. TSU’TEY I can never ride again, or bond with my woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will lead them, Jakesully. 155. No. I’m not officer material. TSU’TEY It is decided. Now do the duty of Olo’eyctan. Set my spirit free. I’m not killing you. TSU’TEY I am already dead. No. TSU’TEY It is the way. And it is good. I will be remembered -- Tsu’tey’s voice is weak, but thick with emotion.

Jake kneels and Tsu’tey opens his eyes. Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake. TSU’TEY (Na’vi) I See you, Jakesully. I See you, Tsu’tey te Rongloa Ateyitan. TSU’TEY Are the people safe? They’re safe. Tsu’tey weakly clutches his severed queue. TSU’TEY I can never ride again, or bond with my woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will lead them, Jakesully. 155. No. I’m not officer material. TSU’TEY It is decided. Now do the duty of Olo’eyctan. Set my spirit free. I’m not killing you. TSU’TEY I am already dead. No. TSU’TEY It is the way. And it is good. I will be remembered -- Tsu’tey’s voice is weak, but thick with emotion. TSU’TEY -- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were brothers -- and he was my last shadow. TSU’TEY’S HAND clasps with Jake’s in a fierce grip. Jake draws his knife. TSU’TEY’S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun. HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu’tey. (Na’vi) Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit.

Scene Name: EXT. HELL’S GATE -DAY160160
Scene Action: Na’vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell’s Gate. Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and the GATES are open to the forest. 156. A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen. Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR’s as the personnel of Hell’s Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry, like POW’s. JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of the Sky People. PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes of a lost soul -- meet JAKE’S. He disappears into the ship.

Scene Action: ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of PANDORA. The ISV’s antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it accelerates out of orbit. What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.

Scene Name: EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY162162
Scene Action: The sun’s rays shaft down through the layers of canopy. The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world. NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows. Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river. This is my last videolog.

Scene Name: EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT164164
Scene Action: THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree. I better wrap this up. There’s a funeral tonight, and I don’t want to be late. It was someone very close to me. WIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people, all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above -- NEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais -- JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA. CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her fingertips. Then bends and kisses him. MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri’s hand comes into frame, stroking his cheek. TIGHTENING slowly to-- ECU JAKE’S EYES. Hold a beat, then -- They open.
