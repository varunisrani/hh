Scene Name: EXT. SPARTANCOURTYARD - DAY44
Scene Action: A boy of eleven is tied at the wrists. His face pressed against a column as a handful of muscular, grim-faced soldiers watch. His back already bleeding as he is whipped again.

SCENE 3:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. PINDOS MOUNTAINS - DUSK66
Scene Action: Blue light crouches on black rocks. Snow drifts, defying gravity. A hand, blistered by the cold, clamors and climbs. The hand belongs to the boy, now twelve. Constantly tested, tossed into the wild. Left to pit his wits and will against nature's fury. Though starving and freezing, there is a nobility in the boy's gaze. Though his body shakes, his homespun tunic no match for the bitter cold, he is defiant. 3. He'd survived on roots, bugs and rodents, and now he was freezing to death. It was his initiation ... his time in the wild ... for he would return to his people a Spartan, or not at all. The boy stumbles into a clearing surrounded on three sides by the stone faces of the canyon. He stands, peering into the gathering din. He grips the spear, lightly moving it back and forth from hand to hand. The spear is little more than a child's toy, a sharpened stick. The boy's eyes search the tree line, the darkness moves ... shadow gliding on muscle and sinew. He hears a low growl. The hair on his arms stands up. Cold, hungry, defenseless. He is prey. It tracks the boy and he knows it. The wolf begins to circle the boy. Claws of black steel, fur as dark as night, eyes glowing red ... jewels from the pit of Hades itself. The WOLF breathes in misty clouds, the swirling snow printed against its black fur. GROWLING as it moves closer, circling, hunting. large enough for him to squeeze through~ His eyes are calm. His body has stopped shaking. He sees the crack in the black stone, and turns slowly, almost casually, toward it. The giant wolf ... sniffing ... drooling ... savoring the scent of the meal to come. Does the boy run? Does he cower? Does he cry? No ... not this boy. He is calm. The beast pauses, loading to spring. The boy leaps through the cut in the rock. The WOLF pounces, HOWLING as it charges! Its jaws are inches from the boy's neck as he falls backward through the wound in the rock. The beast's body is stopped cold in the tight space. Thrashing, the wolf is pinned by the unforgiving stone. The boy rises slowly. 4. It is not fear that grips him, only a heightened sense of things. The snow drifts around his feet. The wolf's jaws GNASH! The boy exhales slowly. The cold air in his lungs. The leafless poplars moving against the coming night. His eyes look back toward the wolf, he nods his respect, then raises his spear. His hands are steady, his form perfect. The clouds part, and the just rising crescent moon, warm on the horizon, casts a shadow of the angry wolf on the cold rock. The boy sets himself, then strikes.

SCENE 4:

Scene Name: EXT. SPARTANCOURTYARD - DAY77
Scene Action: A Spartan helmet lands heavily in the snow-covered courtyard, followed by the thick-muscled frame of a SPARTANGENERAL, who, after going to his knees, bows his head to the snow. Standing before him is the boy, draped in the freshly dressed pelt of a black wolf. As others enter the courtyard, they too fall to their knees, SHOUTING! Spears are raised. CRIES of joy and reverence are heard as the boy raises his chin. So the boy, given up for dead, returns to his people, to sacred Sparta, a King ...

SCENE 5:

Scene Name: EXT. THE CAMPFIRES OF WAR - NIGHT99
Scene Action: Dozens of SPARTANHOPLITES sit and stand, transfixed by the agitated pacing Spartan whose fist is raised in dramatic punctuation. This is DILIOS (28), the storyteller. His gift. His curse. To conjure from his memory, from his imagining, that which men forgot, but need to remember. 5. ... Our King! LEONIDAS! The men visible in the firelight, and countless others in the darkness beyond ... POUND their shields in unison and cry as one. LEONIDAS! LEONIDAS! LEONIDAS! A HUSH falls over the band of Spartan warriors, their faces hard, bodies oiled for war. All listen as Dilios pauses. His voice lowers. It has been more than thirty years since the wolf and the winter cold, and now, as then, a beast approaches, patient, and confident, savoring the meal to come. But this beast is made of men and horses, swords and spears. Dilion scans his audience. The light from the fire moves across the capes of crimson and helmets of bronze. Dilion is a grim orator. His scarred and ruddy face bears witness to his own story. It is an army of slaves, vast beyond imagining, ready to devour tiny Greece. Ready to snuff out the world's one hope for reason and justice. There is brewing anger in the eyes of his listeners. Dilios sets his gaze to the fire. The beast approaches, and it was King Leonidas himself who provoked it.

A PERSIAN MESSENGER with scarred face and sharpened teeth of gold settles the horses. His 20 men-at-arms fill in along his side. I bring word from the Great Xerxes, Conqueror of all the world. The Spartan SENTRIES approach, slowly. One steps forward and sniffs the air, mocking the Persian force. SENTRY/FL Could we offer you a bath, Persian? SENTRYF/2 I am sure our women have a perfume you'll find agreeable. The Persian Messenger pulls at the leather reins of his mount, sinking the bit into the horse's foaming mouth. Greek arrogance! It will be the death of you all. If it were not for diplomacy, I would rip the breath from your lungs. He turns the horse in a tight circle and looks out at the CITIZENS of Sparta who are milling about, Helot farmers, masons, women and children watch as the Messenger glares down at them. Show me your King. SENTRY #1 Our King is a busy man. The Persian Messenger reaches into a waxed canvas bag that lays across the horse's neck. 7. Messenger lifts at the rope running through the bone-white eye sockets of a half-dozen human skulls. These Kings were busy men once.

Scene Name: EXT. SPARTAN GARDEN1212
Scene Action: walls covered, thick and dark, with ivy and wild lilac. KING LEONIDAS (40), strong and lean, a king, a warrior, a father, rolls on the ground in simulated combat with his six-year-old boy, PLEISTARCHOS. Remember, my son. The more you sweat here the less you will bleed in battle. The boy dives at his father, missing the King's legs. Follow your instincts. Leonidas smiles. Act without hesitation. Again the boy tackles and they tumble over each other into the soft grass. Hesitation creates fear. They wrestle on ... continuing one of the ancient rituals of father and son. Fear is always a constant. But accepting it will make you stronger. 8. Leonidas spins and grabs the boy's leg, pulling him to the ground. Leonidas looks across the garden to see his wife, QUEENGORGO(28), with her athletic frame, watching the two of them. In the end, a Spartan's true strength is the warriors next to him. Give respect and honor and it will be returned to you. Leonidas rolls the boy to his back. First, you fight with your head. and fiercely loyal, speaking to Gorgo near stone pillars of the compound. Pleistarchos arches, slips free and reverses to his father's back. Then you fight with your heart. Gorgo lifts Pleistarchos off of his father. What is it? Your father has things to attend to. Leonidas rises to his feet. (to Pleistarchos) Bring me my sword. The boy nods and goes. A Persian messenger awaits you. Pleistarchos returns with a simple short sword of iron, its handle inlaid carnelian and amber. Leonidas arms himself and leans down, kissing his son on the forehead. Do not forgot today's lesson. 9. Respect and honor.

Scene Name: EXT. MARKETPLACE1313
Scene Action: The Persians wait in the full heat of the sun, watched by Spartan guards. Free women and children pass the narrow streets, carrying electrum vases, all shapes and sizes of glass and terra-cotta water vessels. THERON, 36, a Spartan Councilman with noble features, a body of lean muscles and piercing eyes, retired from the battlefield for a life in politics, stands and speaks freely with the Messenger from the East as Leonidas and Gorgo approach. Councilman, you have found yourself needed, for once. Theron allows the comment to disappear into the sounds of the market. My King and Queen, I was just entertaining your guests. I am sure. Leonidas stands before the Persian Messenger. Before you speak, Persian, know that in Sparta everyone, even a king's messenger, is held accountable for the words of his voice. Now, what message do you bring? The Messenger opens his great arms, palms to the azure sky. Earth and water! Leonidas narrows his eyes. You rode all the way from Persia for earth and water? The Persian holds to his message studying the King's face. 10. Do not be coy or stupid, Persian. You can afford neither in Sparta. The Persian turns to Gorgo, never having been spoken to by a woman in this tone. What makes this woman think she can speak among men? Because only Spartan women give birth to real men. The Persian must swallow his pride along with the insult before his men. Let us walk to cool our tongues. Leonidas turns away, leaving the rest to follow the King's steps. If you value your lives over your complete annihilation, listen carefully, Leonidas. Xerxes conquers and controls everything that his eye rests upon. The Messenger throws a look to Gorgo and continues. He leads a force so massive it shakes the earth with its march. Its number so vast it drinks the rivers dry. The Spartan bodyguards watch the Persians carefully. All the God-King Xerxes requires is this, a simple offering of earth and water. A token of Sparta's submission to the will of Xerxes. Leonidas stops in his tracks ... Submission ... ? That's a bit of a problem. Rumor has it the Athenians have already turned you down. And if those philosophers and boy lovers found that kind of nerve ... 11. Theron moves forward. We must be diplomatic. Leonidas raises his hand. ... And Spartans have their reputation to consider. Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas. They may be your last as king. Leonidas looks away from the Messenger's eyes and scans the Persian bodyguards, assessing their strength. TIME SLOWS for our King. He watches the freedoms of his people. The simple pure life each have built for themselves. The words "earth and water" form quietly on his lips. He looks to his Queen, mother of his child. As Leonidas stares at the Messenger. In one motion the King draws his sword, bringing it to the Madman ... you're a madman! The Spartan guards quickly follow their King and hold their weapons to the Persian force before them. Earth and water. Leonidas begins to back the Persian messenger up towards a deep open well. You'll find plenty of both down there. No man, Persian or Greek, no man threatens a messenger. 12. You bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my city steps. You insult my Queen. You threaten my people with slavery and death. I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. I hear your message clearly. It is that of a war party! Leonidas touches his sword onto the dark flesh of the Messenger. This is blasphemy! Theron raises his hands in a desperate attempt to stop Leonidas. This is madness. Leonidas has the messenger's heels hanging above the void of the well. The Persians eye the Spartans nervously. relaxes, thinking reason has prevailed. A warm wind plays against the King's robe. Leonidas looks at Gorgo, she nods, knowing full well what that nod brings to her King and Sparta. And with one great push against the Persian's chest ... Madness? This is Sparta! The Messenger's body falls away ... deep ... deep into the circular chasm. Theron steps back as the Spartan men unleash their savagery. Persian after Persian follows the first, resting where even their faint cries for mercy cannot be heard.

Scene Name: EXT. A ROCKYCLIFF ABOVE SPARTA - NIGHT1414
Scene Action: Lit by the almost full moon, Leonidas climbs hard, with clenched teeth, the steep rock face inaccessible to most. A foot slips. Rocks come loose. His grip tightens and he climbs on, finally pulling himself and his sixty-pound leather satchel onto a small ledge where a cloaked figure stands. 13. The WIND pushes and pulls the torchlight this way and that. This is an EPHOR, a priest of the old gods, deformed by breeding. His face and body are covered with boils and lesions. His eyes are bleached white under the hoods of black. The Ephors. Priests to the Old Gods, inbred swine, more creature than man. Creatures whom even a king must bribe ... and bed. EPHOR #1 Welcome, Leonidas. We have been expecting you. The FIRE ROARS in protest at the end of the torch. The Ephor turns and begins to climb an impossible set of stairs hewn out of the rock of the mountain. Leonidas shoulders the satchel and starts after his ungracious host up the stairs, which circle around a finger of rock toward a simple stone temple that glows at the summit.

SCENE 11:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. EPHORS' TEMPLE - NIGHT1515
Scene Action: Oil lanterns cast a warm light on EIGHT EPHORS, all as decrepit as their brother, who stand around Leonidas as he hastily lays out his plan. At the center of the temple is a low stone box filled with fine sand used by the Ephors to sketch down that which is fleeting to man and even more fleeting to the Gods. Leonidas pulls a wooden block across the sand to smooth its surface. Then, with his finger, he begins to draw. The Persians claim their forces number in the millions. I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate. One of the Ephors interrupts the King, his arms crossed, his blistered face stern. EPHOR #2 You insult the Gods with your arrogance, Leonidas. We are not a council of men. We serve the Gods, not the whim of a King. Before your plan is heard, what do you offer? 14. Leonidas is mid-line, drawing his battle plan in the sand. He looks up at the hooded figures. He lifts a finger slowly from the sand. He ducks the leather strap of his satchel and tosses it at the feet of the Ephors. The gold spills out onto the stone floor. Dipping his finger back into the sand, Leonidas sketches a primitive map. We will use our superior fighting skills and the terrain of Greece herself to destroy them. We will march North to the coast. I will ... EPHOR #1 It is August, Leonidas. The full moon approaches. EPHOR #2 The sacred and ancient festival. Sparta wages no war at the time of the Carneia. Leonidas is desperate, almost angry. He searches the dead eyes of the Ephors. Sparta will burn! Her men will die at arms, and her women and children will be slaves or worse. This is not a campaign for land riches. It is a fight for our very lives! Leonidas plunges his finger back into the sand and draws a line running perpendicular to his line representing the coast. We will block the Persian coastal assault by replacing the great stone wall, built by the Phocians to protect Greece two hundred years ago, and funnel them into the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates. Leonidas holds his hands up in front of his face as if they are the Hot Gates themselves. 15. In that narrow corridor their numbers will count for nothing. The King pounds his fist into his open hand. Xerxes' losses will be so great, his men so demoralized, he will have no choice but to abandon his campaign. The Ephors move uneasily, looking back and forth between each other. Leonidas is mystified by their silence. EPHOR #1 We must consult the Oracle. Trust the Gods, Leonidas. I'd prefer you trust your reason. The Ephor snaps back at Leonidas, pointing a misshapen finger at the kneeling King. EPHOR #1 Your blasphemies have cost us quite enough already. Don't compound them. We will consult the oracle. The Ephors turn away. Leonidas follows them. Carved into the stone, under a domed ceiling, is an altar. It is a stage fashioned to look like the hand of a God. In its palm, a beautiful YOUNGGIRL moves hypnotically. Around the altar the Ephors stoke small fires which burn green with the smell of sulfur, careful not to breathe the smoke themselves, they retreat to the shadows. Diseased old mystics ... worthless remnants of a time before Sparta's ascent from darkness ... remnants of a senseless tradition. Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy, for he must respect the word of the Ephors. That is the law. Leonidas watches as the vapors engulf the girl. She begins to shake and convulse, her body thinly veiled by the sheerest of fabric. The firelight behind her reveals the beauty of her form and the tragedy of her plight. 16. ... And no Spartan, subject or citizen, man or woman, slave or King, is above the law. Then, through the darkness -- DRUMS! The girl's eyes roll back. Her body heaves and writhes. She moans and drools, her hips thrusting, her chest heaving. She CRIES! Through her pleasure and pain. The beating of the drums quicken, as does the violence of her rapture. Her veil clings to her sweaty form until finally she CRIES out! DRUMS stop, and she collapses. After a moment, the Ephors run in extinguishing the fires. One of the Ephors leans close to the Oracle as another pulls a wooden block across the sand, erasing the King's plan. The Ephors choose only the most beautiful Spartan girls to live among them as Oracles. Their beauty is their curse, for the old wretches have the needs of men ... and souls as black as hell. Her breathing is shallow. The old Ephor can't resist letting his tongue lick across the Oracle's neck, tasting her salty skin, before he turns his deformed ear to her mouth, which whispers in trance. As he listens, he speaks in an ancient language spoken only by Ephors. She speaks as he translates. EPHOR #1 Pray to the winds. Sparta will fall. All Greece will fall. Trust not in men. Honor the Gods. Honor the Carneia. Leonidas shows nothing. A WIND HOWLS through the columns of the open temple. He looks into the faces of the Ephors, then turns into the darkness and is gone. The King's climb down is harder. Pompous inbred swine ... worthless, diseased, rotten ...
Characters: LEONIDAS, DILIOS

Complete Content: Oil lanterns cast a warm light on EIGHT EPHORS, all as decrepit as their brother, who stand around Leonidas as he hastily lays out his plan. At the center of the temple is a low stone box filled with fine sand used by the Ephors to sketch down that which is fleeting to man and even more fleeting to the Gods. Leonidas pulls a wooden block across the sand to smooth its surface. Then, with his finger, he begins to draw. The Persians claim their forces number in the millions. I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate. One of the Ephors interrupts the King, his arms crossed, his blistered face stern. EPHOR #2 You insult the Gods with your arrogance, Leonidas. We are not a council of men. We serve the Gods, not the whim of a King. Before your plan is heard, what do you offer? 14. Leonidas is mid-line, drawing his battle plan in the sand. He looks up at the hooded figures. He lifts a finger slowly from the sand. He ducks the leather strap of his satchel and tosses it at the feet of the Ephors. The gold spills out onto the stone floor. Dipping his finger back into the sand, Leonidas sketches a primitive map. We will use our superior fighting skills and the terrain of Greece herself to destroy them. We will march North to the coast. I will ... EPHOR #1 It is August, Leonidas. The full moon approaches. EPHOR #2 The sacred and ancient festival. Sparta wages no war at the time of the Carneia. Leonidas is desperate, almost angry. He searches the dead eyes of the Ephors. Sparta will burn! Her men will die at arms, and her women and children will be slaves or worse. This is not a campaign for land riches. It is a fight for our very lives! Leonidas plunges his finger back into the sand and draws a line running perpendicular to his line representing the coast. We will block the Persian coastal assault by replacing the great stone wall, built by the Phocians to protect Greece two hundred years ago, and funnel them into the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates. Leonidas holds his hands up in front of his face as if they are the Hot Gates themselves. 15. In that narrow corridor their numbers will count for nothing. The King pounds his fist into his open hand. Xerxes' losses will be so great, his men so demoralized, he will have no choice but to abandon his campaign. The Ephors move uneasily, looking back and forth between each other. Leonidas is mystified by their silence. EPHOR #1 We must consult the Oracle. Trust the Gods, Leonidas. I'd prefer you trust your reason. The Ephor snaps back at Leonidas, pointing a misshapen finger at the kneeling King. EPHOR #1 Your blasphemies have cost us quite enough already. Don't compound them.

Scene Action: 17. Gold falls in showers. Printed onto the coins is the likeness of a Persian God or man. ... corrupt ... The Ephors kneel, running their hands through the great pile of gold. Standing in the firelight, is Theron. At his side, a large PERSIAN, his body crisscrossed with chains and giant locks of ancient iron, tosses a handful of gold onto the pile. Theron turns to the Persian. Leonidas will not march. The word of the Oracle is final. What of your Spartan Council? Could they not vote to ignore these mystics' words. The members of that Council are as superstitious as they are old. Your gold is well spent. When I am made ruler or all Greece and Sparta is its capital, her people and armies will serve the God King well. You have only to remove the Spartan Queen and its heir for your plan to be complete. You need not instruct me in the course of my own treachery. This plan was born long before Xerxes turned his eye to Greece. It rose from my hatred of Leonidas' measured judgment ... It rose from my envy of his skill in battle ... It rose from my lust for the warmth of his young bride. All the hate in my soul will find itself manifested on his house, and his victories, his love, his freedom, his very blood will lie in ruin at my feet. Theron turns to the Ephors. 18. This is but a token. Great Xerxes gives his thanks, oh wise and holy men. You are truly in the God King's favor now. The Persian smiles, his face adorned with gold piercings, his eyes pale blue. Yes, for when Sparta burns, you will bathe in gold. Fresh oracles will be delivered to you daily, from every corner of the empire.

Scene Name: INT. LEONIDAS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT1717
Scene Action: The waxing gibbous moon shines onto the stone floor of the King's bedroom. It is a second-story room overlooking a small courtyard. Beyond that, edged by moonlight, the roofs and houses of sleeping Sparta. Leonidas leans of the frame of his balcony doorway, unable to sleep. After a moment he sighs and moves to his bed, where his wife Gorgo sleeps soundly, the sheet down to her waist, revealing her strong feminine back, which shines with the warmth of August. Leonidas sits at the edge of the bed and lightly traces his finger along the contours of her body. She stirs, and now, sleepily, she stares up at him. Your lips can finish what your fingers have started ... Or has the Oracle robbed you of your desire as well? It would take more than words of a drunken adolescent girl to rob me of my desire for you. Gorgo smiles. The curls of her black hair fall softly across her neck and collarbone. Then why so distant? 19. Because it seems, though a slave and captive of lecherous old men, the Oracle's words could set fire to all that I love. She reaches up to him, laying her hand to the side of his face. So that is why my King loses sleep and is forced from the warmth of his bed. Gorgo furrows her brow in mock concern. There's only one woman's words that should affect the mood of my husband ... and those are mine. He smiles, if only briefly. He is in pain and she can see it. What must a King do to save his world, when the very laws he has sworn to protect, force him to do nothing? Gorgo sits up. She is tender, yet intense. She looks into his eyes for a moment, then her expression softens. It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen should do, nor a husband, nor a King. Instead ask yourself, my dearest love, what should a free man do? He looks at her. They are close. The moment stretches and he smiles. They kiss and fall back onto the bed. This is love between a Spartan King and his Queen. Their skin is wet. Their mouths hunger. Their muscles flex. It is not soft. It is passion personified. They love as they live.

SCENE 14:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. SPARTAN BARRACKS1919
Scene Action: The sky is pale and clear to the east as 300 Spartans hold rank in a field of golden wheat. Leonidas and his Captain walk past the familiar face of Dilios, who nods to his king. Is this all of them? 20. As you ordered. 300 with born sons to carry on their name. A Spartan named STELIOS (28), lean and hard-bodied, speaks up from the line of soldiers. We are with you, sir, to the death. The Captain turns and barks at Stelios. Hold your tongue, boy? Or I'll take you at your word. Leonidas makes eye contact with Stelios, then points to a young Spartan, with the soft face of a child near the rear of the pack. He is your own and too young to have felt a woman's warmth. Leonidas stands before the baby-faced warrior. I have others to replace him. The Captain stands next to his King, and glances into the eyes of his son, ASTINOS (18). He is as brave and ready as any. No younger than we were the first time you stood next to me in battle. You are a good friend, but a better Captain, there is not. Leonidas places his hand on the Captain's shoulder, as if to mark his selfless act. In the morning light, a group of COUNCILMEN are led forward by Theron. My good King, the Oracle has spoken. The group stands before Leonidas, trying to gain his attention. 21. The Ephors have spoken. There must be no march. Leonidas continues to view his men with a disciplined eye. The law, my Lord. The Spartan Army must not go to War. Nor shall it. You worry over nothing. Theron and the councilmen view the assembly of warriors. I have issued no such orders. These 300 are my personal bodyguards. Our army will stay in Sparta. Leonidas looks away from his 300, to his Queen and child who have now joined the group. We'll head North. Gorgo pulls her son into her hip. The Hot Gates. Leonidas looks at his family. What do we do? What can we do? You will listen to your queen in my absence. The throne of Sparta rests with her. Leonidas lifts his shield and looks back at his 300 men. The Captain nods that his men are ready. Leonidas calls back to the Spartan Councilmen. What can you do? Sparta will need sons. 22. Leonidas moves toward his men, to begin their long march North. Spartan! Leonidas turns to his wife's voice. Yes, my lady. The Queen walks to him, lifting from her neck the simple leather necklace, attached is a wolf fang. Her husband's first boyhood enemy. Come back with your shield... or on it. Leonidas bows slightly, as she passes the necklace over his head. Yes, my lady. There are no tears from her eyes, nor trembling in his voice. Goodbye, my love. He doesn't say it. There is no room for softness, not in Sparta. No place for weakness. Leonidas and his 300 start to march from Sparta. Only the hard and strong may call themselves Spartans. The King knows he will never see her again. He will never see Sparta again. They march on! Only the hard. Only the strong.

Scene Name: EXT. MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS2121
Scene Action: against soil. In silence, they march over the sharp rocks and earth, looming steadily, weaving a small shapeless mass of men North. We march. For our lands. For our families. For our freedoms. On the broken ridgeline more men appear, other pockets of strong Hoplites from city-states that have heard the call to war. Noisy Arcadians greet us with noisy complaints. Leonidas leads his men and greets the Arcadians. Daxos, a pleasant surprise. DAXOS, a tree trunk of a man, circular shield strapped his back, leads the Arcadian force. This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas. His men look at the small Spartan numbers and begin to murmur among themselves. We have been tricked ... There can't be more than a few hundred of them ... This is a surprise ... Silence. The men settle and listen... listen carefully to the words that will come. We were told Sparta was on the warpath! We were eager to join forces. If it is blood you seek, you are welcome to join us. 24. Daxos scans the Spartans, counting quickly the rows of men, unmoving under the weight of their armor as if carved from the mountain itself. But you bring only this handful against Xerxes? I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's commitment to at least match our own! Leonidas sits atop a smooth, moss-covered stone. Doesn't it? Leonidas glances to the Arcadians. You there. What is your profession? A small-framed ARCADIAN steps forward. ARCADIAN #1 I am a potter, sir. Leonidas points to another. And you, Arcadian. What is your profession? Another Arcadian responds from group. ARCADIAN #2 A sculptor, sir. Leonidas points again to the crowd. And you? ARCADIAN #3 A blacksmith. Again the King points. You? ARCADIAN114 A baker. Leonidas stands, turning to his 300. 25. Spartans! What is your profession? From the silent mass of Spartan muscle, 300 spears and swords are raised to the sky, a collective battle cry exits each, thunder and fire that spits forth from their bellies. Haaawooo! The Spartan weapons lower and raise again and again each time the men grow louder with their chant of war. Haaawooo! Leonidas nods softly at his men and turns to Daxos. You see, old friend? I brought more soldiers than you did.

Scene Name: INT. GORGO'S PRIVATE GARDEN - SPARTA - DUSK2222
Scene Action: On the ground, simple oil-fed cauldrons burn bright, casting shadows that dance along the branches of olive trees. Gorgo meets with a Spartan LOYALIST near the garden's roughly chiseled steps. Is such secrecy needed? When is one to trust beyond the walls of their own home? Even here, Theron has eyes and ears that fuel Sparta with doubt and fear. Don't worry. Leonidas and his men are strong. It is not his strength that worries me ... if Xerxes is not stopped ... He will be stopped. 26. If Persians advance beyond the narrows to the North, they will leave no one to tell our story. They will grind Spartan bones to flour and serve them to their Army. The Loyalist reflects on the Queen's words. I now bear the weight of the king's responsibility. If Leonidas fights for what he believes, so must I, here in Sparta. Gorgo stands beneath an arbor of lavender. I can arrange for you to speak to the Council. Many would vote to commit all we have and follow Leonidas, but you must show them favor, explain why their King would betray the law of his land. Laws created by men who have never shown valor. Is it recklessness or valor? Without reason the Council can believe either. Gorgo watches a Spartan guard on horseback ride out of the city into the blackness of night. I will go to the Council, and if it is reason they want, I will let them know. Know what, my Queen? How precious this liberty we enjoy is. Why freedom isn't free at all. It comes with the highest of costs. The cost of blood. The Loyalist nods in agreement with his Queen. 27. I'll bring together the city's council, and its chamber will be filled by your voice. The Loyalist gathers himself and readies to leave. Why do you do this? Leonidas is my King, as well as yours. The Loyalist bows his head and goes without sound, leaving the Queen to view the stars that spread across the obsidian night.

They watch the bursts of dying sparks jump out of the flames and vanish. No sleep tonight? Not for the King. Leonidas studies the fire. Too restless ... eager as a youth ... eager as a beardless wet-nosed cadet for battle. Leonidas looks towards his men and then back to the Captain. They share a moment and nod, a moment only shared and understood by men who have given themselves fully to one thing their whole lives. Leonidas' voice quiets. All my forty years have been a straight road to this one gleaming moment in destiny. This one radiant clash of shield and spear and sword and bone and flesh and blood. Leonidas returns to the fire, watching it dance. The King's eyes close for a moment. Just a dream of sleep would be enough. 28.

Scene Action: The day has turned and grey mist rises in ghostly shapes from the spine of the mountains. The band of brothers descends through the merciless heat. Astinos points to the ridgeline. We are being followed. The silhouetted figure looms, watching the Spartans' progress. It has followed us since Sparta. A Persian scout? The Spartans rest for a moment. No. Its stride is more beast than man. Stelios points to thin columns of black smoke on the blue horizon. Look, my King.

Scene Name: EXT. GREEK VILLAGE2525
Scene Action: As the Spartans and Greeks enter. Buildings still smolder and fall to ash. A complete wasteland, void of hope and song, filled with smell of slaughtered livestock and the dead. What happened here? Where are the people? Leonidas scans the details of the destruction. Footprints in the wet earth, hooves of strange beasts, torn bits of a peasant's dress. Leonidas crouches, tracing with his finger the claw-like footprints in the blood-soaked earth. Persians. The Captain kneels next to Leonidas after surveying the scene. 29. I put their numbers at around twenty. A scouting party ... But these footprints ... What could have ... A child! The Spartans turn to see the naked form of a CHILD. A phantom, her thin pale body, covered in dirt and dried blood. The mass of Greek warriors part as she moves between them and stands before Leonidas in silence. Water. It's quiet now ... They ... they came with beasts from the blackness ... monsters ... dark-skinned ... cold eyes ... from my nightmares. The Child is stoic in her telling of the tale. With their claws and fangs they grabbed them ... everyone ... everyone but me. I've found them. A Spartan points to a massive wind-blown tree at the top of a hill. The Child collapses at the feet of the King. Leonidas slowly lifts her into his arms. He closes the eyes of the lifeless child and looks towards the lone ancient tree. Where VILLAGERS, MAN, WOMAN,CHILD have been strung out like Christmas ornaments, hundreds of Persian arrows pierced through their limbs and bodies. Have the gods no mercy! We are doomed. Quiet yourself. 30. The Spartans and free Greeks move slowly towards the haunting tree. Leonidas stands without expression, holding the dead child. The child speaks of the Persian ghosts, knows from the ancient times, bound by the myth and magic of the night ... They are the hunters of men's souls. Some of the Greeks nervously look at each other. They cannot be killed or defeated, not this darkness, not these immortals. Leonidas lays the small child's frame at the base of the tree. Immortals? We will put their name to the test.

Scene Name: EXT. HOT GATES - SUNSET2626
Scene Action: Leonidas pauses, watching the men stream down past him into the narrow canyon called the Hot Gate. The WIND HOWLS through the ancient cut in the mountains and the crimson Spartan capes ... ... SNAP like flags. We march ... from Lakonia ... from sacred Sparta ... we march ... for Honor's sake ... for Glory's sake ... we march ... Into hell's mouth.we march. Leonidas nods to a few passing brothers, dust swirls as the Captain and his son pass. Leonidas and the Captain share a moment which causes the Captain to slap a strong hand on his son's back, smile at him, a father and son joined in battle, and then turns back to Leonidas. The look of pride still on his face. The Captain makes his way through the current of soldiers to stand next to his King, his friend. 31. As the troops thunder past, the two survey the landscape for a moment, looking down through the Hot Gates to the ocean. Dilios stops and points into the far distance. Look! Persians! Countless Persian ships bob like toys on an angry sea, pulling down distant sails in preparation for a coming storm. Black bellies of clouds mix with the last light of day. Did you know the God King Xerxes requires no less than 8,000 slaves to move and assemble his personal compound. That the zoo of animals that accompany him consume over 100 tons of wheat, hay and meat a day. That their Persian war brothel is contained in over 80 tents and its number of concubines, goats and war boys outnumber us 3 to 1. And that the column of carts that bear the skins and barrels of fermented barley and wine is over 15 miles long. Well, at least we'll die with the stench of Persian whores on our cocks and the taste of Persian wine on our lips. Die perhaps ... or live forever. An optimist. I can afford to be ... I've got you on my side. The Captain nods to his friend as the nearing soldiers clamor by ... You do indeed. The burden of Kingship you bear alone, but our friendship we bear together. Dilios takes a few steps past Leonidas, following the men who head down to the sea, then turns back to them. 32. Come, let's watch these motherless dogs as they are embraced by the loving arms of Greece herself. Leonidas takes a look at the sky and then back to the Persian fleet. True, it does look like rain.

Scene Name: EXT. SEA CLIFF2727
Scene Action: Lightning flashes across a violent sky, exploding the mast of a Persian trireme. The vessel is tossed on giant SURF, CRASHING it into the rocky coast. Let the others scurry for cover. We rush to bear witness. The Gods play. Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts. Boreas howls, bullied... and batters the sea with hurricane wind. Daxos joins Leonidas and his men as they stand above the sea on the cliff watching as one after another, the Persian fleet is smashed in SLOWMOTION, to kindling. Below, another bolt of lightning briefly illuminates faces of the countless drowning slave oarsmen gasping for breath among the splintered timbers of the Persian Armada. Poseidon rises, rudely awakened, furious, his surf clawing at the stars. The RAIN POUNDS against Leonidas' shield like war drums as he drinks in the carnage below. Glorious. Behind Leonidas, his men laugh. Cries of jubilation are heard. The men embrace and Daxos raises his fist in victory as another massive Persian ship explodes onto the rocks and again the surf surges made viscous by flesh and wood. Laughter, song and praise for the Gods that will continue to the next day's dawn. 33. Then another flash of lightning as the men behind dance with time suspended, in ecstasy of jubilation. Leonidas, jaw set, face cold, stern and motionless, says nothing. Only one among us keeps his Spartan reserve. Leonidas slowly lowers his shield, allowing the rain to run down his unmoving face. Only he. THUNDER mixed with laughter and the pounding sea. The distant cries of a host of drowning Persians. Leonidas lifts his chin in slow motion to the rain and closes his eyes, breathes the salty air and turns back through his men to the Spartan camp. Only our King.

Scene Name: EXT. NEAR THE PERSIAN CAMP - DAWN2828
Scene Action: A handful of Spartans moves silently through the misty forest at a pace impossibly fast for the lack of sound. No helmets, no shields. FLASHES of red and steel between the trunks of mountain pines. A Spartan points to the edge of a bluff just in front of them, the forest silhouetted by the bright sky, telling Daxos they have reached the overlook they had ventured into the woods to find. He crawls on his belly until he is next to the Spartans who lie at the cliff's edge looking down on the Persian encampment. Daxos' breath catches in his throat as terror grips him staring down on the camp of his enemy. has ever seen, for the valley below him, which stretches five miles across, bordered on one side by the sea and on the other by the mountains, contains from edge to edge a city of tents complete with roads that team with people and carts and horse and creatures no Greek eye has seen before. At the coast, countless thousands of ships are being unloaded and tended to. Vast legions of men march this way and that, the smoke from the tens of thousands of fires has created a cloud of black that drifts and clings over the nearby mountains. 34. I saw those ships smashed on the rocks. How can this be? We saw but a fraction of the monster that is Xerxes' army. The Spartan smiles, shaking his head at the sheer spectacle. We are doomed. There can be no victory here. Why do you smile? Arcadian, I have fought countless times ... Yet I have never met an adversary who could offer me what we Spartans call a Beautiful Death. I can only hope with all the world's warriors gathered against us that there might be one down there who's up to the task. With that he slaps a hand on Daxos' back and laughs.

This day your son will prove himself. Ephialtes' feet trample over the wild scrub and withered flowers sheathed in dust. I will show you that you were not wrong to protect me. I will show you that I am worthy. Ephialtes stops at the edge of a high cliff, cupping his misshapen hand towards his face, inhaling deeply, smelling, questioning the air itself. Bastards. 35. A PERSIAN GENERAL carried atop a golden throne, surrounded by BODYGUARDS. He whips his slaves and pushes them on. Persian bastards! We'll kill all of you. Ephialtes grits his teeth and growls at the passing Persian display. We Spartans will destroy you.

Bodies straight, teeth clenched at the zenith of a military push up, they hold that pose. On each of their backs stands another Spartan with shield, helmet, spear and cape. Muscles shake and quiver under 200 pounds of men and armor. Daxos rushes into the Spartan campsite. Leonidas turns from his men who can be heard in the b.g. Leonidas is calm, almost pleasant. Daxos, you're up early for an Arcadian. Daxos is scared, he points in the direction of the sea. A Persian General approaches. You should come and speak to him. It is our one chance for survival. The King nods slowly at Daxos. You are the King. Your men are ill- prepared for the delicate matters of state. I fear the welcome that this ambassador will receive and the message it sends to Xerxes. Leonidas smiles at Daxos. 36. No, on second thought, I am busy. My boys will meet him at the wall and I think you will find them quite prepared to show him a proper Spartan welcome.

Scene Action: Persians advance up the primitive highway. The Persian General's gold litter, carried by twelve slaves at a dead run, suddenly slows as it approaches the Hot Gates. Fear grips the dark-skinned slaves who carry the General. More afraid of what they see than the General's whip. Perhaps King Xerxes sent his General to negotiate our surrender. Or perhaps he wonders why he has not heard from his scouts. As they round the last bend, the Hot Gates still in the distance, they are greeted by two dozen dead Persian scouts. Each impaled by a spear so that it protrudes from his mouth. The shafts of the spears inside their bodies cause them to sit upright. The dead scouts adorn the rocks and dirt mounds, a signpost to the General that he is headed in the right direction. His handful of bodyguards are frozen as they stare at the gruesome display.

Scene Name: EXT. WALL OF THE DEAD3333
Scene Action: Near the entrance to the Hot Gates. The Persian General half- stands out of the ornate chair, borne on the shoulders of bleeding slaves, to better see who among his enemies are gathered at the wall which now acts as a barrier, funneling would-be attackers into the Hot Gates. A large group of Spartans work at putting the finishing touches to the wall. Stelios puts a large rock in place at the top of the wall and, already sweating hard, glances at the approaching General who calls up to him. You there! Who commands here? Stelios stares down at him, then to the water below. He takes a breath and leaps fifty feet to the sea. His form is perfect. The General watches as he hits the water headfirst with barely a splash. The General looks at the men as they work on the wall. No one has stopped. The General stands, frustrated, on the platform supported by slaves, and calls again to the men working on the wall. I am the emissary of the Ruler of all the World, the God of Gods, the King of Kings and I demand by that authority that you show me your commander. One or two of the Arcadians look over their shoulders at the Persian General. Listen and learn, Spartans. I am tired of your petulance. 38. Stelios climbs the cliff face up out of the salt water. He leans against a boulder and begins sharpening his sword with a found stone. Do you think that the paltry dozen you slew scares us or means anything to us? They are nothing to the great Xerxes. Why, these hills swarm with our scouts. They watch us even now. They move like shadows. The men still work, moving the rocks, handing them to one another, ignoring the Persian General, who laughs a one- breath laugh and looks to his nervous men. He then points at the wall. Do you think your pathetic wall will do anything except fall like a heap of dry leaves in the face of ... His words catch in his throat as he sees that the wall before them is built not just out of stone. limbs, and bodies of countless Persian scouts. Even their horses have not been spared. Their faces in grim crimson and black clotted blood against the gray of stones. The General and his-horrified bodyguards scan the wall which looms before them. A monument to death. Stelios lowers his chin, glides his sharpening stone one last time down the length of his BLADE which -- RINGS with sparks and the song of iron on stone. The General struggles for something to say. Our ancestors built this wall using ancient stones from the bosom of Greece herself and, with a little Spartan help, you Persians supplied the mortar. You will pay for your barbarism. And with that, he loads his whip to strike. Stelios, without hesitation, closes the distance to the General in a heartbeat. Rising in a powerful leap, his freshly sharpened sword FLASHES through the General's arm at the elbow. 39. The General's litter crashes to the ground. His slaves dive for the protection of nearby rocks. Stelios stands over the General as he grips his stump in pain, blood pumping between his fingers. Each of his bodyguards frozen at spear point by the now agitated Spartans. My arm! It's not yours anymore. Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes he faces free men here. Not Slaves. Do it quickly before we decide to make this wall just a little bit bigger. The General breathes a labored breath, swallows hard and narrows his brow. Not slaves, no. Your women will be slaves, though. Your sons and daughters, and elders will be slaves. But not you. By noon this day you will be dead men. Stelios is unmoved by the General's speech. One hundred nations of the Persian Empire descend upon you. The General is helped back to his golden perch and his slaves shoulder his lighter weight. He turns one last time, to the massive wall, to the men that built it, and the butcher that took his arm. Our arrows will blot out the sun. Stelios never changes his expression. His eyes are as cold as the bracing AEGEAN which CRASHES relentlessly on the cliffs below. Then we will fight in the shade.

Atop the brown stones and pale ground stands Ephialtes, like a broken creature. There is such a route, good King. Ephialtes lowers his bronze shield to reveal his entire body. Just past that western ridge. It's an old goat path. The Persians could use it to outflank us. The Captain steps forward and levels his spear at Ephialtes' frame. Not one step closer, Monster. Ephialtes bows his head towards Leonidas. Wise King, I humbly request an audience. The Captain stands firm. I'll skewer you where you stand! Leonidas lowers his spear in front of the Captain's chest, stopping him from advancing towards Ephialtes. I gave no such order. The Captain looks to his King away slowly, and backs watching Ephialtes as he returns to his men who prepare for the Persians. 41. Forgive the Captain. He is a good soldier ... but a bit short on manners. Ephialtes squints and shortens his gaze to Leonidas. There is nothing to forgive, brave King. I know what I look like. You wear the crimson of a Spartan. Ephialtes steps closer to the King, lifting his head with pride. I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta. My mother's love led my parents to flee Sparta, lest I be discarded. My father became a shepherd ... but he taught me the warrior's way. Your weapons and armor? My father's, sir. Silence lays between the King and the eager soul. I beg you, bold King, to permit me to redeem my father's name by serving you ... in combat. Leonidas leans onto a smooth, cool stone. You will see ... Day and night my father trained me. Ephialtes opens his stance and twirls the shaft of his spear, blurring the speed of its arc. To feel no fear ... to show no pain ... to make spear and shield and sword as much a part of me as my own beating heart. Ephialtes jabs his spear towards Persian camps in the the distance, breathing, growling at the imaginary men that fall before him. 42. You see? My arms are strong and my reach is long. I will earn my father's armor, noble King ... and reclaim my family's honor. A fine thrust ... I will kill many Persians! Leonidas stands, shadow towering over the warped form of Ephialtes. Raise your shield! Ephialtes stops his attack. Sir? Raise your shield as high as you can. Ephialtes lifts the shield. He is half hidden behind the circle of hammered bronze. Your father should have taught you how our Phalanx works. We fight as a single impenetrable unit. That is the source of our strength. Leonidas demonstrates the defensive stance. Each Spartan protects the man to his left from thigh to neck with his shield. A single weak spot ... and the phalanx shatters. Leonidas takes his hand to the top of Ephialtes' shield and measures the height, a good two feet shy of the needed mark. From thigh to neck, Ephialtes. The King shakes his head slowly as Ephialtes lowers his shield. 43. I am sorry, my friend, not all of us are made to be soldiers. But I ... Leonidas places his hand on the shoulder of Ephialtes. If you want to help Sparta in its victory, you can clear the battlefield of the dead, tend the wounded, bring them water, but as for the fight itself, I cannot use you. The King turns quietly away and heads down the slope of limestone towards his 300. Mother, Father, you were wrong. Ephialtes turns away, towards the cliff's edge. You are wrong, Leonidas. You are wrong! But the King continues, growing smaller in the distance. Ephialtes turns and leaps from the cliff, disappearing from the high outcropping of rock, making not another sound. The Captain watches as Leonidas crosses the folds of rock, windblown brush, shade-dappled grass, fine as thread. (to the Captain) Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path and pray to the Gods that nobody tells the Persians about it. The Earth begins to shake and lift, rocks loosen and cascade down the cliff face. The Spartans and the other Greeks steady themselves. The distant RUMBLING GROWS... STRONGER... LOUDER! Battle formations! Without hesitation the Spartan guard and others move quickly, grabbing their weapons. 44. For a beast approaches ... savoring the meal to come.

Scene Name: EXT. PERSIAN ENCAMPMENT3636
Scene Action: And from the very sea itself, the Persian tents and rally- points empty and break ground. They charge upwards through the valley. They come in hordes, forward, fast, over the rocks and shallows, they race on. A force of men so massive it shakes the earth with its march. Brown bearded forms, chest panels of crocodile cover ragged men, smoothed leather head covers adorned with seashells and human bones. An Army so vast ... beyond imagining. The Persians flow upward, through the valley floor and foothills of the mountains. Poised to devour tiny Greece. Like locusts the Persians swarm over the land, destroying beneath their advance all that holds life. Nothing is spared. To snuff out the world's one hope for reason and justice.

Scene Name: EXT. HOT GATES3939
Scene Action: Leonidas settles himself as the rest of his men arrive. They form quickly around their King, quieting their racing hearts, and listen to his words over the Persian juggernaut. This is where we hold them! The Spartans watch as the earth moves and undulates, heaves forward, alive with forms dressed in loose silk and cloth. They carry curved swords, ivory-handled daggers tucked into belts of gold. Horsemen whip the infantry forward, while others reach into wicker quivers that hold arrows from the East. This is where we fight! The Spartans lower their shields into a perfect phalanx, a solid wall of bronze from one side of the Hot Gates to the other. Each man protects the next, each with spear extended towards the Persian wave. This is where they die! The Persian funnel off the Wall of the Dead up the last steps of the Hot Gates. Remember this day, men, for it will be yours for all time. A snow-white Arabian and RIDER slows ... the mass of Xerxes' machine of war slows ... as the golden shields of Leonidas and his Spartans are revealed. 46. Spartans! The air is heavy with the smells of leather, iron and sweat. Leonidas and his 300 do not move, only their breath can be heard against each other's backs. Lay down your weapons! single javelin through the air. It settles quickly into the chest of the Persian Horseman, toppling him from his mount, dead before he touches Greek soil. Leonidas narrows his eyes to his enemies. Persians ... Come and get them! And with the defiance of the Gods themselves, Leonidas starts what many speak of but few have the heart for. WAR BEGINS! RUMBLING. Strange HORNS and CALLS TO WAR lift from the Persians, as if to warn of the Apocalypse that will follow. Shoulder to shoulder. The Spartan phalanx snaps to a perfect oak and bronze wall of defense. Beneath the hammered bronze, eyes locked forward, towards the howling enemy. The front rows of the Phalanx lower their lances of cornel wood and ash, eight feet from hand to razor-tipped end. This stand of men appears unworldly, as if some breathing metal beast that lays coiled, ready to attack. The force of Persian RAIDERS drops down the last open space and funnels straight to Leonidas and his men. Hold. The Spartans brace for battle. Give them nothing. 47. Assyrians, Arabians, Bactrians, Cappadocians, Medes, Karians, Babylonians, Armenians, and other Asiatic tribes, a hundred nations thunder forward at the Spartan line. But take from them, everything. The Persians close within twenty yards of the forest of Spartan arms. Steady, boys. CRASH! East meets West. Wicker meets bronze. The Spartan line grits its teeth against the massive Persian onslaught. Thousands of Persians push against the wall of Spartan bronze. Sandals slide, plowing the earth as Spartan feet are forced back. A Persian blade draws the first Spartan blood, grazing across the shoulder of a young Spartan. He cries out in anger, breathing hate into the Spartan will. Leonidas strains as he and his men finally slow the tide of silk and wicker, steel and dark skin. They find a foothold that stops their backwards movement, and all at once a thousand Persian eyes grow large with fear as Leonidas lowers his body, pushes forward, thrusting through Persians two at a time. The Captain rolls over the enemy without pause. Piercing through the silk leggings, puncturing their lungs with such power that the air escapes the chest wounds in great geysers. Push on!!! They push on, never breaking their impenetrable human wall. Aaaahhhh! Dilios' jabs land, cutting into Persian throats, the cries of pain muffled as they fall under the trampling feet of Spartan advance. Push!!!! They push on ... The Spartans gather strength from Greece herself, the invaders fall upon each other, one after the other. 48. lands, GROANS and SCREAMS drift out and fall back to the lifeless bodies from which they came. Clear ... to the right. Scared Persians, hearts pounding in hollow determination, fall quick prey to the skill of the Spartans. No prisoners! Haaawooo!!! They step and thrust, killing all before them. No mercy! Haaawooo!!!! A deafening advance, the Spartans repel the Persian discharge with ease, forcing the incalculable numbers backwards. They look thirsty. Give them something to drink, boys. To the cliffs! The Spartan phalanx jolts too. Electrified, they push their burnished defense, relentless, driving over Persian bodies, grinding towards the coastal cliffs. Leonidas lurches, skewering another. The rear columns of attacking Persians begin to fold and fall away, over the high cliff's edge and into the sea below. forms. High-pitched wails and caterwauls bleed forth and crumple back onto the force as they are pushed over the rocky line. By the hundreds they fall, embroidered tunics and mail jackets tumble, continuous and measured screams sing out as the Persians distort and separate into the churning salty grave. 49. Hold. With the King's voice, the Spartans stop and watch the last Persian sail over the cliff face and disappear without a sound. Hell of a good start. Haawooo! HARPIES SCREECH and arrows cut loose. Tuck tail! The Spartans drop to a knee and cover their bodies with the bronze shelter from the incoming storm. The first wave of bronze heads sink into the ground around Leonidas and his men. Shaft after shaft rains into the Spartan shields, momentarily obscuring the sun with their volume. Persian cowards. Bowmen reach into their quivers and send more missiles by the thousands, an attack of size and strength never seen by Leonidas and his men. Astinos crouches, laughing beneath his makeshift bronze roof. What in the hell are you laughing at? You had to say it. Arrows pound off their shields, deflect, SHAFTS SNAP, they fall in a deluge, pinning Astinos' robe to the ground. What? Fight in the shade. 50. They both begin to laugh and now the others join in. As the last shrieking volley is cut loose ... All is silent, save the Spartans laughter on the battlefield. Settle down. Leonidas looks to his Captain. Let them laugh. It scares the fight out of our enemy. The Captain nods. Recover. A cry erupts from the back of the Spartan formation. In the front position, Leonidas sees the mass of beast and men they now offer. His eyes widen to the sheer force and he sets his body for the impact. No heroes ... Today no Spartan dies! Astinos looks to his Father. The Captain nods softly, a simple gesture of recognition that comforts his son before Hell arrives. Nostrils flare as the giant sand-colored beasts thunder down upon the Spartan line. The Captain locks his shield into his body. Stelios fights back fear, his breath quickening in time with the advancing mounts. An explosion of pure violence. Persians are thrown from their strange mounts, bodies trampled; sweat and blood runs freely. Terror carved and molded to each Persian face. We do what we were trained to do! The Spartans advance with tremendous velocity, half-naked forms, red ribbons, brilliant bronze armor rushing forward without pause. What we were bred to do! 51. The Persians fight with curved swords, small war axes and hammers engraved with lions' heads. What we were born to do! It is as abstract as it is brutal. Persian men, torn limbs, unclothed bodies, crushed and bloody, wounded figures, empty hand-tooled saddles, beheaded camels, faceless masses clutching to breath and pulse, one by one falling again and again to Spartan endurance. No prisoners! No mercy! A good start.

Scene Action: marketplace. Pleistarchos playfully darts between stone columns and pools of bright sunlight. The two move in a loose pair past dark chambers, where BLACKSMITHS-- -- POUND bronze and iron into blade and bowl. Potters shape red clay in vessels and plate. Gorgo stops at the mouth of an alley and calls to her son, who has disappeared behind a gaggle of HOUSEMAIDS, who bicker and gossip. I am not chasing after you. The Queen waits a moment and sighs. That's it, I'm leaving. Do you hear me? Gorgo turns down the alley shaking her head. She passes the red homespun fabric, freshly dyed, they hang drying in the midday sun. The shadows of the hanger bars flash across her face as she moves between the blood-red fabric walls into a small courtyard. Carved out of stone is a simple bearded face and out of the stone mouth, water flows, falling into a small pool. The Loyalist sits, ringing a rag out in the clear water and places it on his neck. I was afraid you might not come. 52. He stands to his feet as Gorgo approaches. I'm sorry, my son ... is ... She turns back towards the alley. Doing what children do best. Please don't apologize. Gorgo relaxes a bit, made comfortable by the Loyalist's manner. He starts the Agoge next year. That is always a hard time for Spartan mothers. Yes ... it will be hard, but also necessary. The Loyalist ponders with a smile, remembering his time enduring the Spartan crucible. In two days you will speak to the council. Gorgo answers quickly. My husband does not have two days. Leonidas has chosen his battles and so must you. These two days are a gift. The Queen nods. It's no secret that Theron wants what you control. It is his voice you must silence. Make an ally of him and you will have your victory. The moment hangs between them both. My son will be looking for me. Thank you ... You are as wise as you are kind. 53. The Loyalist bows and moves off down a passageway. Gorgo turns to the fountain and splashes water on her face, relief from August heat. She pauses, letting the water pour over her hands, staring into the stone eyes of the fountain. From behind her, a voice. There's your mother. Gorgo turns to find Theron and Pleistarchos. Her son's eyes are nervous as Theron grips his shoulders from behind. Gorgo moves towards them both; Theron lets her son go and he runs to her side. You should keep a better eye on him if he is to be King one day. Gorgo pulls her son into her. Theron studies the faces of both Queen and son. It would be unfortunate if anything were to happen to him or his beautiful mother. Gorgo narrows her gaze at Theron.

Scene Action: It is a vision of Hell on Earth. Thousands of Persian dead lay in heaps. The ground turned to mud by the countless gallons of blood. The Spartans work gathering weapons from the fallen and putting the few Persians whose injuries have not killed them, out of their misery. Leonidas and the Captain pull off their helmets. As they do, the Captain sees a Persian crawling among the nearby dead. He moves casually over to him. The Captain looks back toward Leonidas, tossing the King an apple. As Leonidas bites into it, the Captain puts a heavy foot on the Persian to steady him, then plunges a spear through his back. The Persian cries out, then dies. The Captain pulls his spear free and moves to the King. The Arcadians are itching for battle, sire. They're begging for a crack at the Persians. 54. Good! I've got something I think they can handle. Tell Daxos I want them eager, sober, and ready for the next charge. Stelios runs the last few yards right up to Leonidas and the Captain. (breathing hard) King Leonidas. Stelios, catch your breath, boy. Stelios puts his hands on his thighs and drops his head for a moment. Yes, My Lord. He breathes deeply, then swallows. Persians approach, My Lord. A small contingent. Too small for an attack. Leonidas looks in the direction of Stelios' spear which he uses as a pointer. Captain, you are in charge. But, Sire ... Leonidas smiles at the Captain. Relax, old friend. If they assassinate me, all of Sparta goes to war. Leonidas becomes more serious, his voice lowers. Pray they're that stupid ... pray we're that lucky. Leonidas begins to move across the landscape of the dead as the Captain sighs, then sees another breathing Persian and raises his spear. 55. Besides, there's no reason we can't be civil, is there? The Captain buries his spear with crisp precision and the life groans from one of the nameless horde of his enemy. None, sire.

SCENE 36:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. COASTAL PLAIN4343
Scene Action: A clearing between the Hot Gates and the Persian camps. Leonidas slows to a stop. His expression a subtle smile. A mix of amusement and disbelief at the display before him. For, wedged between the sea and the jagged rock face of the mountains, is a sight as impressive as it is absurd. 100 men bear on their backs a giant golden throne beset with sculpted lions. Ancient script as old as time itself is carved upon the platform. It rises 20 feet above the shoulders of the bent slaves who carry it. At its summit, surrounded by golden gazelles and backed by a black sun, stands XERXES. Nearly 7 feet tall. Body of lean sinew, hairless, androgynous, and draped in adornments of gold. Let me guess. You are Xerxes. Xerxes moves down the richly carpeted stairs of his throne platform to the waiting Leonidas. Xerxes steps down, using the back of a kneeling slave as the final step. A voice as smooth as warm oil on well-worn leather and as deep as rolling thunder. Come, Leonidas. Let us reason together. Xerxes glides on powerful legs as Leonidas stands next to him. It would be a regrettable waste ... it would be nothing short of madness were you, brave king, and your valiant troops to perish all because of a simple misunderstanding. 56. Don't lose sleep worrying over us. We're having the time of our lives. Xerxes stops and turns to the Spartan King. Brave words. Spartan words. I admire you. The strength and honor of your soldiers, their fierce devotion. There is much our cultures could share. Haven't you noticed we have been sharing our culture with you all morning? Xerxes smiles. Yours is a fascinating tribe. Even now you are defiant, in the face of annihilation and the presence of a god. Leonidas looks up at Xerxes. There is a fundamental difference between us. You would kill any of your men to win and I would die for any of mine. As Leonidas and Xerxes stand together, silent archers pull bows taut, keeping an eye on the Spartan King. You Greeks take pride in your logic. I suggest you employ it. Consider the beautiful land you so vigorously defend. Picture it reduced to ash at my whim! Leonidas is unmoved. Consider the fate of your women. 57. Clearly you don't know our women. I might as well have marched them up here judging by what I've seen. You have many slaves, Xerxes, but few warriors. It won't be long before they fear my spears more than your whips. Leonidas turns away from Xerxes and scans the hillside. Rocks fall in a cascade from a nearby cut in the cliff. Xerxes gently puts his hands on Leonidas' shoulder. It is not the lash they fear, it is my divine power. I am a generous God. I can make you rich beyond all measure. Xerxes leans closer to Leonidas, his voice goes to a hush. I will make you warlord of all Greece. You will carry my battle standard into the heart of Europa. Your Athenian rivals will kneel at your feet, if you will but kneel at mine. Leonidas exhales deeply, then steps out from under the God King's hand and looks at his feet. You are generous as you are divine, oh King of Kings. Such an offer only a madman would refuse. The Spartan King then takes a few slow steps away from the towering Xerxes. But the idea of kneeling, it's ... you see slaughtering all those men of yours has put a nasty cramp in my leg. So kneeling will be hard for me. You sadden me, Leonidas. For as I am reasonable, so am I vicious, and as I am generous, so am I wrathful. Xerxes' body tenses under the weight of diplomatic words. 58. There will be no glory in your sacrifice. I will erase the memory of Sparta from the histories. Every piece of Greek parchment shall be burned. Every Greek historian and every scribe shall have their eyes put out and their tongues cut from their mouths. Xerxes is afire, voice raised in contempt for the Spartan King. Why, uttering the very name of Sparta or Leonidas will be punishable by death. The world will never know you existed at all. Leonidas turns to Xerxes, eyes as cold as ice. The world will know free men stood against a tyrant. That few stood against many, and before this battle was over, that even a God King can bleed.

SCENE 37:

Scene Name: EXT. HOT GATES - SUNSET4444
Scene Action: On the flat steps, before the Hot Gates. Stelios and Astinos work piling Persian corpses into a great mound at the Wall of the Dead. Muscles strain under the lifeless bodies. The sun has just passed below the mountains, and promise of the night's cold is first spoken by the breeze which rises off the sea. You fought well today, for a woman. Stelios tosses the body he's carrying onto the pile. As did you. Maybe if I am injured you will be able to keep up with me. Astinos grunts as he heaves a cool body onto another, as Stelios drags a body by the ankles. Maybe I was so far ahead you did not see me. 59. The Captain behind them lifts two bodies over his shoulders and begins to move towards the youths. More likely offering your backside to the Thespians. Jealously does not become you, friend. Stelios throws another on the heaping head. The two smile at each other. The Captain climbs onto the bodies of his enemies, one Persian over each shoulder, heaving them at Stelios' feet. Leonidas calls up to them, out of breath, from the foot of the pile. Move it, men! Pile those Persians high. Leonidas glances back towards the Persian camp, as a wind of dusk tosses crimson behind him. We're in for one wild night! Yes, sir.

Scene Name: EXT. COASTAL PLAIN - NIGHT4545
Scene Action: The worn road to the Hot Gates. Quiet grips the black cliffs. The sea laps onto ageless rock. A light breeze whispers in the trees and then out of the darkness ... They have served the dark will of Persian Kings for 500 years. Clouds roll against the quarter moon. Black banners * cover the sky. Eyes as dark as night. Teeth filed to fangs ... soulless. 60. The war DRUMS POUND like the heartbeat of a Titan. A river of black bronze surges toward the Hot Gates. Wordless, their form. Faultless, moving in such perfect unison. Each collective step strikes the earth like a blow from the Fire God's Hammer. They march! Feet pound the earth. Barely the feet of men, toenail-like claws. WE RISE SLOWLY ALONG the form of black armored skin. Muscular arms protrude from ornate plates inlaid with gold. Maybe ancient writing or design. Only dead men have seen close enough to know. DILIOS (V. 0.) The personal guard to King Xerxes himself. The Persian warrior elite. The deadliest fighting force in all Asia. One of the thousands turns TO us, scanning the hillside as his demon brothers pass behind him. A hiss of breath, he bares his saw-blade teeth. His black eyes, shark-like, searching for Spartan blood. DILIOS (V. 0. ) The Immortals. A nameless Immortal at the front of the column holds up his fist and, as one, they stop. The Immortal lowers his fist slowly, takes a few tentative steps out of formation and scans the obstacle in his way. A wall of stone and fresh Persian dead, 20 feet high, that runs from cliff wall down to the sea. He stares up at the grotesque sight of his comrades. Something new rises from his belly, freezing his joints, making his breath catch in his throat. Something he has not felt in countless forays on the battlefield -- FEAR! DILIOS (V. 0.) Now, while we are fresh and at our full strength. Before wounds and weariness have taken their toll. 61. The Immortal at the front reaches with shaking hands to the two sabers slung at his back. Stepping slowly away from the wall, he frees the two long arcing blades and nervously watches the wall for movement. The mad King throws the best he has at us. Xerxes has taken the bait. WE MOVEACROSS the faces of the dead at the top of the wall, until we COMETO REST ON the dull gold of a Spartan helmet, the unblinking eyes of Leonidas is hidden among the dead. Spartans, push!!! From behind the wall, a hoard of crimson and bronze presses as one against the wall of corpses, which tumbles onto the horrified immortals, breaking like waves onto the first six rows of the Persian elite. Spartan shields and spears, surging down on the stunned Immortals. Leonidas plunges his spear, reaching three deep into the ranks of his enemies. He instantly lands a strong foot into the chest of the skewered man, pushing him with a single powerful stroke of his spear and turns to the next. Immortals. Well ... As our King said, we put their name to the test. With his shield, Stelios blocks a blade strike meant for the Captain who flashes young Stelios a look before ramming his own spear through the attacker's eye socket. This is the hardest fighting they have faced. War cries howl from the Immortals as they battle the Spartans. spear, in a single move, draws his sword to dispatch another surging at his side. The blood of his enemies sprays across Leonidas' face as the Spartans push forward into the columns of confused Immortals. Stand your ground! 62. The COMMANDER is bumped by a retreating soldier. He grabs the fleeing soldier and pushes him back toward the fighting. He yells, spitting his rage. I said stand your ground!!! Leonidas parries a blow and then drives his spear into another Immortal. One of the Immortals leaps onto the shield of a Spartan attacker. His toes grabbing the bottom of the shield like an ape's hands, pulling the swords at his back free and slicing across the neck of a Spartan soldier, killing him. The Spartans begin to lose ground to the recovering Immortals. They claw as they rally, their fangs tearing into Spartan flesh. Leonidas fights two at a time, grimacing through clenched teeth. He falls back as the Immortals take their toll on the now withering Spartans, locked in a hand-to-hand struggle with one of the demons. The Immortal's gnashing teeth are just inches from Leonidas' face. Leonidas is barely able to draw his sword, plunging it into the Immortal's throat. Now from the heart of the Immortal horde, the largest and fiercest of the Immortals rushes forward, a full seven feet tall at the shoulder, veins in his neck bulging like serpents as he roars, collapsing a Spartan shield with a kick while in the same moment decapitating another Spartan not quick enough to retreat behind his shield. The giant Immortal focuses his milky eyes on Leonidas, who fights and dispatches two of the dark horde. Leonidas locks eyes with the giant, who recognizes the Spartan king and charges toward him. Leonidas quickly recovers a spear and thrusts it at the charging monster, who rises into the air on a thundering stride, cutting clean in two the spear shaft of the king. He lands with his full 370 pounds of crushing muscle on the shield of Leonidas, throwing him back onto the mutilated bodies of the day-old fallen. Leonidas, lying on his back, recovers his wits just long enough to have his sword kicked from his hand. The giant roars again, pulling Leonidas' helmet off, which spins to rest on the blood-soaked earth. The Immortal pulls his blade down toward the exposed head of the king, who raises his arm, catching the raw metal blade with a roof block on his bronze- covered forearm. 63. Then Leonidas summons from deep within his warrior soul a crushing right to the jaw of the demon, who spits blood as he roars in defiance. The thing tosses his sword down as he moves right into Leonidas' face, roaring as he opens his mouth. A mix of blood and saliva pours in rivulets between the sharpened teeth of the giant while his eyes fix on Leonidas' neck. The king's muscles strain beneath the mass of the Persian Immortal. In desperation, Leonidas calls ... Arcadians ... NOW!!! The giant Immortal is inches from Leonidas' neck when he hears the battle cry of the Arcadians. The monster is momentarily distracted, allowing Leonidas to strain the last remaining inches to reach his sword. He lifts the giant off him on two powerful legs and in the same motion passes his sword between the giant's head and shoulders. The monster's head lands next to the king as his body tumbles to one side. Immortals, the earth begins to move. The trees fall, revealing a box canyon filled now with charging Arcadians. Daxos leads his men as they cut into the Immortals. Daxos comes right at the Immortal Commander, who is raising his saber, ready to cut down his own men. Fight or die where you stand! The eyes of the soldier the Commander threatens go wide, as he sees past his master to the ambushing Greeks descending upon them. The Commander sees his fear and turns just in time for Daxos to plunge his spear through the Commander's neck. Go! Show the Spartans what we can do. Daxos pulls the spear free and turns quickly, throwing his spear into an Immortal's chest. Daxos draws his sword, fighting on. Thrusting, jabbing; missing a parry, his arm is cut. In exchange, he plunges his sword into one of the dark horde. Call us amateurs, will they? 64. They shout and curse, stabbing wildly, more brawlers than warriors. Free Greeks all, teeth clenched in a battle rage, thrusting spears and swords through the frightened throngs of their enemies. Pushing, legs driving shields against piceous bronze. Forcing dozens of heavily-weighted Immortals off the cliffs and into the sea. They make a wondrous mess of things. Brave amateurs, they do their part. hungry by the wide-eyed terror of the Immortals. They fall over each other to flee the attacking Spartan King. As the slaughter continues below, from the cliff overlooking the battlefield, silhouetted by the crescent moon, a dark figure adorned in gold watches as his invincible Immortals fall like wheat under the sickle of the Spartan phalanx. ...

SCENE 39:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. SPARTAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT45A45A
Scene Action: Dozens of Spartan campfires reach into a nigrescent sky. They burn bright, fueled with a kindling of broken Persian arrow shafts by the thousands. Around the fires, warriors mend their wounds with linens and oils of root and herb. They drink of red wine and recount with pride the heroics of the battlefield. 65. Our King! WE HEAR a ROAR so primitive it shakes the ground and ECHOES OFF the far canyon walls as the other Spartans sound off. Haaaawoooo! Our honored dead! Haaawooo! Leonidas says nothing, just stares quietly towards the heavens along the far edge of the fire circle and beyond. Triumph. Yes, the day is ours. And the night too. True, for now they fear the night as well. Dilios moves with the shadowed light, in front of his brothers. Now, as we rest, the Immortals crawling back to their master whipped dogs. The Captain nods slowly and wipes the now cold blood from his hands with a captured turban. Every Persian sees it. Whom will Xerxes dare to send next? They will never measure as fine as this. 66. The Captain lifts a red-hot iron rod from the fire's mouth and puts it against a young Spartan's side, burning, smoldering the skin, cauterizing the gaping hole without a sound or expression to fill the night air. Who among his legions will dare to face us?! The Captain throws the rod back to the fire and again a cheer from the Greek warriors rings into the night. Haaawoooo! Leonidas turns and moves through their war party. Children ... children! Their King's voice quiets their folly. The Medes and Scythians are in open revolt! Xerxes is slaughtering his own troops. There is nothing that can stop now! Leonidas raises his hand, holding some invisible force that quiets the men. Dare we hope ... Dare we hope for more than a glorious death? Leonidas lowers his hand and gazes over each of the men's faces, half-filled with firelight. Such mad hope... but there it is. Leonidas points out into the darkness of the battlefield. Against Asia's endless hordes. Against all odds. The Spartan King returns his eyes to his warriors. We can do it! We can hold the Hot Gates! We can win! 67. The Spartans erupt into a chorus of voice. Haawwooo!

Complete Content: Dozens of Spartan campfires reach into a nigrescent sky. They burn bright, fueled with a kindling of broken Persian arrow shafts by the thousands. Around the fires, warriors mend their wounds with linens and oils of root and herb. They drink of red wine and recount with pride the heroics of the battlefield. 65. Our King! WE HEAR a ROAR so primitive it shakes the ground and ECHOES OFF the far canyon walls as the other Spartans sound off. Haaaawoooo! Our honored dead! Haaawooo! Leonidas says nothing, just stares quietly towards the heavens along the far edge of the fire circle and beyond. Triumph. Yes, the day is ours. And the night too. True, for now they fear the night as well. Dilios moves with the shadowed light, in front of his brothers. Now, as we rest, the Immortals crawling back to their master whipped dogs. The Captain nods slowly and wipes the now cold blood from his hands with a captured turban. Every Persian sees it. Whom will Xerxes dare to send next? They will never measure as fine as this. 66. The Captain lifts a red-hot iron rod from the fire's mouth and puts it against a young Spartan's side, burning, smoldering the skin, cauterizing the gaping hole without a sound or expression to fill the night air. Who among his legions will dare to face us?! The Captain throws the rod back to the fire and again a cheer from the Greek warriors rings into the night. Haaawoooo! Leonidas turns and moves through their war party. Children ... children! Their King's voice quiets their folly. The Medes and Scythians are in open revolt! Xerxes is slaughtering his own troops.

Damn you. Damn you, Gods! Damn you, Father ... Damn you, Mother ... Damn you all to Hell! Ephialtes lifts his father's bronze helmet toward the faultless sky, inspecting the color, its worn strength. Spartans ... Spartans! He throws his helmet to the ground. The boldest of men! The finest warriors in all the world. Ephialtes grunts in disgust to himself. Damn you ...

Scene Action: 68. The second day begins as the first. With full light at their backs, barriers of man and beast pound the earth, into the slaughter they race. Silhouetted forms, WHIPS CRACK! Across the backs of a fresh rotation, flooding upwards, across the slain and haunted bodies. The men pull from their guts a low growling HOWL! One hundred nations descend upon us. The Armies of all Asia. Funneled into this narrow corridor, their numbers count for nothing. They claw and dig into the muddy ground, barreling towards the Hot Gates and the awaiting Spartan line. Back to hell with you. Blood and terror pounding at the temples of the oncoming pack of Xerxes' front men. The raiding party arrives, unfortunate for being the first to meet the Spartan Nation. Attack, now! They collide with such force into the bronze shields, shudder cycling through SNAPPING! Fresh bones. Others push from behind, but nothing is gained as Leonidas plows his pike through the chest of one and moves quickly at silencing another. Armless PERSIAN GIANTS run with wicker baskets .on their backs. Within the baskets, MIDGET ARCHERS cut loose a volley a projectiles. At our wall of bronze and crimson, there is no retreat, there is no surrender. Only honor ... duty ... glory ... combat ... victory. They fall by the hundreds ... We send the severed bodies and fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet. Stelios rams against the hordes, cutting through thin tissue and capillaries, lashing out, moving in pace with his brothers on the steep slope. 69. Tribesmen, tattoos covering their bodies, sling broken shards of glass and porcupine quills into the fight. Astinos drops his lance into a Persian thigh and strokes upwards, through the groin and out the chest cavity. When muscle failed they turned to their magic. But we were relentless ... unstoppable ... We were free men ... We are Spartans. PERSIAN WIZARDS, draped in black velvet robes, throw clay pots mixed of sulfur, bat dung and ash. Its noxious smoke rising, obscuring the fight. Dilios nails two charging infantrymen with the tip of his spear. Robbing them of any glory, any hope of tomorrow.

Veins bulge in his forehead and neck; he grits his teeth. His rage spitting from his mouth, he commands the executioner, whose form is grotesquely muscled. Where his forearms should be, his flesh and hands have been removed. His very bones sharpened into twin executioner's axes. He disciplines them.

Scene Name: EXT. HOT GATES5353
Scene Action: 70. Xerxes dispatches his monsters from half the world away. Elephants adorned with spikes and cleated stomp through their own men. Their trunks fitted hammers and bladed sickles. They swing, clearing to the Spartans. THUNDERING! Up the constricted path, on the gray massive backs, Xerxes' men, 10 deep, archers, javelin throwers, young boys throwing stones down into the battle. They are clumsy beasts and the piled Persian dead are slippery. The elephants lose footing, some topple, others shift in fear. A Persian meets his fate, skewered through a charging tusk. Others are tossed like a desultory of tribesman, off the beast and disappear under the charge of nations. Break ... Now! And with the coming magnitude of Persians, the Spartans open the phalanx and swallow the enemy whole. Leonidas is in perfect form, cutting the enemy down, each stroke and parry, a grace for others to emulate. His shield takes a crushing blow from a Persian battleaxe. He counters and yaws forward, surrendering his spear tip into the face of a Persian Commander, snapping it clean, he draws his sword. Watch them! In front, Stelios and Astinos break free, filled by youth. They cleave their swords into an open space of Persian dead. Stelios buries his blade, the Persian falling at his feet. Are you still here? Stelios pulls at his steel, stuck in the corpse he just felled. If only you fought as much as you ran your mouth. 71. Astinos laughs and swings through a string of Persians that streams toward Stelios, still trying to free his blade. Not now, I am a little busy. Astinos is dynamic, effortless, and brave as he takes three Persian guardsmen. He cuts and pulls at them, dropping the first. Stelios frees his sword, tearing it loose and reenters the fight. Astinos drops the second and turns to Stelios. They continue on, all of the Spartans, beating back among the promontory of the dead. Regroup! The Spartans pull into one another, gathering force, streaming into the Persians like a wall of intimidation. Astinos rages on, killing the dark figures without pause. Astinos. Astinos looks to his father across the salient, the Captain locks eyes with his son. On center. They share a moment of praise among this tenebrous day. From the middle of the fray a PERSIAN HORSEMAN, clothed in inked leather and iron mail, gallops through the melee. He raises his sword and with one arc. For all who see it, the combat stands still. It is no more brutal than the rest, only that it's one of their own, a Spartan. The Captain watches as Astinos is beheaded only a few yards away. Noooo! Astinos' head falls to the muck and mire, another Persian lifts the severed gift in his hands and tosses it up to the confident horseman. He holds the head above his and howls. A prize offering for Xerxes, he rides back towards the sea, never offering fight for a father's pain. 72. They all die! The Persians retreat back, with their treasure, a young Spartan face. The Captain's rage rises; he runs after the force hacking into the backs of fleeing men. The day wears on ... We lose few, but each felled is a friend ... or dearest blood, and upon seeing the headless body of his own young son the Captain breaks rank. He goes wild ... blood-drunk. Dilios and Stelios follow him, allowing his frenzy to run its course until all the enemy life has been snuffed out. Finally a group of Spartans drag the Captain from the field, his face twisted with grief, his tears etching lines in the mix of blood and dirt on his face. The Captain's cries of pain at the loss of his son are more frightening to the enemy than the deepest battle drums. It takes three men to restrain him and bring him back to our own. The day is ours. No songs are sung. The Persian camp goes deathly quiet.

Scene Name: INT. SPARTAN HOUSE5454
Scene Action: A wood fire burns in the corner, illuminating the simple mason and beam ceilings. Theron and Gorgo stand in conversation. I am not here for small talk, Theron. I am sure of that. You have never spared words with me. Theron walks to a rimmed table, tanned cougar hide covering its base. A drink? Gorgo studies his face and with a laugh. 73. Is it poison? He lifts a high pitcher, inlaid of silver palmette rising from acanthus leaves. I am sorry to disappoint you, my Queen. It's just water. He pours the water into two shallow bronze bowls, hammered with the images of a seated fox and hen. He hands the water to Gorgo. I am told you are going before the Council. I am not seeking your advice, just your help in winning votes to send our Army north to their King. Theron turns to face Gorgo in the half-lit room. Perhaps I could help. The two of us standing together, the politician, the warrior, our voices as one, but what does your willingness prove? Gorgo takes a sip from the bowl and sets it on the near table. It proves that I care for a King who at this very moment fights for the water we drink. Theron nods in agreement. True. But this is politics, not war. He sets his water down and looks at the Queen. Leonidas is an idealist. The Queen paces across the near window. 74. I know your kind too well. You send men to slaughter for your own gain. Your husband, our King, has broken the laws. He has left without the council's blessings ... I am simply a realist. You are an opportunist. And a bad one at that. Theron closes the distance to the Queen. You're as foolish as Leonidas if you believe that men don't have a price in this world. All men are not created equal. The Spartan code reinforces this maxim, you silly little girl. Without hesitation, Gorgo slaps Theron clean across his face. He is unmoved by the blow. I admire your passion. But don't think that you, a woman, even a Queen, can walk into a council chambers and sway the minds of men. Regardless of what your king says, you have no power there. I own those chambers, as if they were built by these hands. He grabs Gorgo by the throat, she struggles for a moment under his power. I could crush the life from you right now! Gorgo searching the room, nothing, to aid her plight. You will speak to the council and your words will fall on deaf ears. You will receive NOTHING without me. Leonidas will have NO reinforcements and if by the Gods' grace returns, he will be jailed or worse. 75. Gorgo looks at Theron in disbelief. Do you love your Sparta? Gorgo's eyes lock with Theron as she GASPS for air. Yes. His grip tightens around her neck. And your King? I do. Theron smiles again as he watches Gorgo squirm under his powerful grasp. Your husband fights for his for his land, for his love. Theron releases his grip on the Queen's neck. What do you have to offer Sparta? What does a realist want with his Queen. I think you know. Gorgo trembles, knowing that this sacrifice is the one Theron truly wants. She lifts her hand and pulls at the soft lace that holds the dress at her neck. This will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy this. I am not your KING! There are no tears. Gorgo stands naked before Theron, as he begins to ravage her, she makes not a sound, not a move. She gives him anything and everything, but not her heart in the faint firelight of the room.

A world of fine silk walls, rugs from the Orient, soft pillows, towers of honeycombed candles. Incense burns and hangs in tooled copper baskets. A procession of slave girls, all near naked, sheer gauze and jeweled bodies, dance for Xerxes in the faint light. Your Gods were cruel to shape you so, friend Ephialtes. Under a canopy of soft light, Ephialtes moves from the shadows. But I am kind. Xerxes on a marble pedestal, adorned in rare diamonds and emeralds from lands far from where he now stands. Everything you could ever desire. Concubines of all shapes, colors and nations are brought forth for Ephialtes. Every happiness you can imagine. Ephialtes squints his one blue eye at the spectacle. Every pleasure your fellow Greeks and your false Gods have denied you. The dancers writhe against Ephialtes' frame. I will grant you ... for I am kind. 77. Ephialtes wipes the drool, the sheer temptation from his lips and speaks. Yes. Embrace me as your King and as your God. Yes. Lead my soldiers to the hidden path that empties behind the cursed Spartans. Yes. The dancers reach deeper into the heights of their tortured bodies. Your joys will be endless. Yes. Xerxes opens his impressive arms, extending his jeweled hands to his Greek guest. You will create your destiny. The dancers have now thinned into the b.g. The MUSIC softens and DRIFTS AWAY. Now there is only the God King and the Quasimodo named Ephialtes. I want it all ... Land ... Wealth .. Women... and one more thing. Ephialtes shuffles closer and opens his eyes wide for erxes to view. I want a uniform. Xerxes folds his arms over one another and simply nods. Done. 78. Ephialtes takes a deep breath, as if to breathe in his newfound wealth and treasures. You will find ... I am kind ... Unlike the cruel Leonidas who demanded that you stand. I require only that you kneel. And with those words, Ephialtes lowers his warped body, head following his hands, crumpling his weight down to both knees and bows before Xerxes without more celebration or thought.

----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. SPARTANEN CAMPMENT5858
Scene Action: The air rings as blacksmiths hammer blades, shields and spear tips for the next morning's contention. Leonidas pulls at his tattered cape, wanders the different campfires, watching his men's faces as they recover from the day. Dilios, I trust that scratch hasn't made you useless? Dilios crouches near the firelight, binding a crude bandage across his face and head. Hardly, My Lord. It's just an eye. The Gods saw fit to grace me with a spare. My Captain? Dilios rises and points to a sole campfire raging atop the ridgeline. He curses the Gods and mourns alone. Leonidas nods quietly. Daxos rides into the Spartan encampment. Leonidas, we are undone! Daxos dismounts, dropping the leather reins and without haste, covers the ground to Leonidas. 79. Undone I tell you! Daxos' eyes dart around the blackness beyond the firelight searching nervously the high cliff face and then returns to the King. Destroyed. Leonidas has heard enough and barks out. Calm yourself. Daxos breathes deep and returns to his frightened rant. A hunchback traitor has led Xerxes' Immortals to the hidden goat path behind us! The Spartan warriors straighten to this news as if ice has been run through their veins. The Phocians you posted there were scattered without a fight. This battle is over, Leonidas. The Spartan King turns his back to the Arcadian. This battle is over when I say it is over, Daxos. Daxos continues to plead his case. By morning, the Immortals will surround us. The Hot Gates will fall. Spartans! Prepare for Glory! His Warriors have already begun preparing their weapons, armor and bodies for their shared fate. Glory? Have you gone mad? There is no glory to be had now. Only retreat or surrender or ... death! 80. Leonidas turns now to face the man who breeds doubt into the minds and hearts of his tribe. He glares into the eyes of Daxos. That's an easy choice for us, Arcadian. The King snaps his response with a steel of character even his enemies admire. Spartans never retreat! Spartans never surrender! Go spread the word! Let every Greek assembled know the bald truth! Let each among them search his own soul! And while you're at it ... search your own. Stelios holds out the reins for Daxos' horse. My men will leave with me. Daxos takes the loose reins in his hands. Godspeed, Leonidas. The King is unmoved, and watches Daxos leap to the bare back of the pearl mare. Daxos heels the horse's side and disappears. Leonidas wastes not a moment and turns to his men. Children, gather around. Stelios, Dilios, and Spartan warriors close in around their King. The Gods favor us. The Spartans roar out. Haaawooo! Tomorrow, we light a fire that will burn in the hearts of all free men for all the centuries yet to be. 81. The Spartans stomp the dry earth in unison, like a thundering pulse that runs through them all. No retreat ... No surrender! This is Spartan law! Haaawooo! Leonidas moves in front of his men, reaching into their will and stirring their souls. And by Spartan law we will stand and fight and die! The warriors erupt, POUNDING their shields and raising their weapons towards the star-filled blanket above. The law. We do not sacrifice the rule of law to the will and whim of men. That is the old way. The old, sad, stupid way. The way of Xerxes and every creature like him. Leonidas stands clearly in front of his brave men. His red cape lifts and floats with his every impassioned gesture. A new age has begun. An age of great deeds. An age of reason. An age of justice. An age of freedom. And all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it! Haaawoo! From the blackest corner of the Spartan encampment ... WE face and body smeared and covered, a mixture of ash, soot, and his son's blood. My friend. Leonidas reaches out to his Captain. 82. I have lived my entire life without regret until now ... It is not that my child gave his life for his country. The Captain shakes his head slowly from side to side. Only that I did not tell him that I loved him the most, that he stood by me in honor ... that he was what is best in me. Leonidas embraces his friend for a moment. My heart is broken for your loss. The Captain nods softly. Heart? I have filled my heart with hate. The Captain looks into the flickering flames and back to his King. Good. The Captain's eyes search deep into the valley, to the Persian camp below. Dilios, let's take a walk. Dilios nods his bandaged head. Yes, My Lord.

Complete Content: The air rings as blacksmiths hammer blades, shields and spear tips for the next morning's contention. Leonidas pulls at his tattered cape, wanders the different campfires, watching his men's faces as they recover from the day. Dilios, I trust that scratch hasn't made you useless? Dilios crouches near the firelight, binding a crude bandage across his face and head. Hardly, My Lord. It's just an eye. The Gods saw fit to grace me with a spare. My Captain? Dilios rises and points to a sole campfire raging atop the ridgeline. He curses the Gods and mourns alone. Leonidas nods quietly. Daxos rides into the Spartan encampment. Leonidas, we are undone! Daxos dismounts, dropping the leather reins and without haste, covers the ground to Leonidas. 79. Undone I tell you! Daxos' eyes dart around the blackness beyond the firelight searching nervously the high cliff face and then returns to the King. Destroyed. Leonidas has heard enough and barks out. Calm yourself. Daxos breathes deep and returns to his frightened rant. A hunchback traitor has led Xerxes' Immortals to the hidden goat path behind us! The Spartan warriors straighten to this news as if ice has been run through their veins. The Phocians you posted there were scattered without a fight. This battle is over, Leonidas. The Spartan King turns his back to the Arcadian. This battle is over when I say it is over, Daxos. Daxos continues to plead his case. By morning, the Immortals will surround us. The Hot Gates will fall. Spartans! Prepare for Glory! His Warriors have already begun preparing their weapons, armor and bodies for their shared fate. Glory? Have you gone mad? There is no glory to be had now. Only retreat or surrender or ... death! 80. Leonidas turns now to face the man who breeds doubt into the minds and hearts of his tribe. He glares into the eyes of Daxos. That's an easy choice for us, Arcadian. The King snaps his response with a steel of character even his enemies admire. Spartans never retreat! Spartans never surrender! Go spread the word! Let every Greek assembled know the bald truth! Let each among them search his own soul! And while you're at it ... search your own. Stelios holds out the reins for Daxos' horse. My men will leave with me. Daxos takes the loose reins in his hands. Godspeed, Leonidas. The King is unmoved, and watches Daxos leap to the bare back of the pearl mare. Daxos heels the horse's side and disappears. Leonidas wastes not a moment and turns to his men.

His King's eyes are bright and clear. A tale of victory. Victory? Dilios shakes his head slightly. Leonidas lets the moment stretch, then smiles at him. He squeezes his shoulder and, nodding, lets him go. Yes, My Lord. Dilios begins to turn and then slows. Sire, any message ... ? For the Queen? Leonidas is gone. Transported by thought, across time, set free from the bonds of politics and responsibility. For a fleeting moment he is just a man, separated by circumstance from his reason for living, His Love.

A transition few are good at, but all carry its burden and responsibility. alone into the acriform, chin lifted, hair braided, head high before the Spartan lawmakers. The ADVOCATES,STATESMEN, and PARTISANS settle into primitive seats that coil around the stone floors, thrusting forth a stage for the Queen to offer her words. May I give the floor now, to the wife of Leonidas and Queen of Sparta. The Loyalist bows slightly as Gorgo walks towards him. She nods and the Loyalist returns to his seat. Gorgo stands, radiating not only her beauty but sheer internal strength. She scans the faces, appraising the crowd. She knows them all, her eyes even cross Theron. Gorgo shows not a trace of emotion as she clears her throat and begins. Councilmen, I stand before you not only as your Queen. She shifts into the amber light that now floods through the windows. I come to you as a mother. The chambers quiet to her voice. I come to you as a wife. Gorgo moves slowly on the stage. 86. I come to you as a Spartan woman. She looks to Theron, locking eyes with him until he pulls his contact away. I come to you with great humility. Theron leans forward, listening carefully. I am not alone in this room. Gorgo looks again to Theron, she points, just past him to a STATESMAN in the seats to her left. Theron relaxes. You, your son fights at his King's side. The Statesman nods to his Queen. As she turns quickly to another. Have you forgotten your fine boy? A PARTISAN shakes his head softly, thinking of his young. No. Gorgo turns again, using all caution with her words. I am not here to represent Leonidas. His actions speak louder than my words ever could ... I am here to speak for all the voices that cannot be heard. Mothers, daughters, sons, fathers. Gorgo takes a breath, centering her thoughts. 300 families that bleed for our rights and for the principles this very room was built upon. The Queen looks to the members of the council. 87. You must not forget from where you came. All in this chamber once carried arms, to defend Sparta. You are men that now balance peace and war. That balance has been challenged. We are free only because of some fight to ensure it. Gorgo walks slowly, building her strength. We are at War, Gentlemen ... We must send the entire Spartan Army to aid our King in the preservation of not just ourselves, but our children. The Queen delivers with all her conviction and passion. Send the Army for the preservation of liberty ... Send it for justice ... Send it for law and order ... Send it for reason ... But most importantly send our Army hope. Hope that a King and his men have not been wasted to the pages of history. That their courage bonds us together. That we are stronger by their actions and that your choices today will reflect their bravery. ears, confidences are passed freely among them. Theron watches as Gorgo has quickly made work of his room. He claps, slowly rising to his feet. Moving, eloquent, passionate. Theron rests his hands and scans the faces in the chamber in silence. Why do you waste the time of these important men? Gorgo turns to the arrogant voice. 88. Do we waste your time? Each man in this room is no more important than the next. You insult the council, my Queen? That is not my intention. What is your intention? Gorgo speaks to the seated audience with clear words. Only to remind us, that each day we determine our course. Course? Yes. These days are men's true riches. And they're being fought for at this very moment as we choose words. A STATESMAN rises and calls out. Your husband has brought war upon us! Gorgo shakes her head. You are wrong. Xerxes brought it forth, and before that, his father Darius at Marathon. The Persians will not stop until the only shelter you will find is rubble and chaos. Theron begins to walk down to the stage floor. This chamber does not need a history lesson. Gorgo watches carefully as he descends the stairs. 89. Then what is the lesson like to leave? Theron presses on. Shall we begin to enumerate all of them? Honor. Duty. Glory. Theron takes the stage from the Spartan Queen. You speak of honor, duty and glory. What of Adultery? His voice BOOMS out into the chambers and a hush is leveled onto the listeners. Gorgo's eyes wide, stunned by his treachery. How dare you speak out in such a manner. How dare I? Gorgo studies the room, quickly searching out friend or foe. Watch her carefully, she is a trickster in true form. He narrows his attack. Do not play with the members of this sacred room, my Queen. Just hours ago you lay with me. The chambers go wild at his telling. I have your scent on me still. This is an outrage! Two armed Spartan warriors now appear from a depression of the antechamber and flank Gorgo's left and right sides. You look shocked. A bribe of flesh I was given while her husband promotes anarchy and war. 90. I ... you ... Words escape even the cleverest tongue, my little whore Queen. Gorgo's eyes burn with fire fed from the pit of her stomach. You ... bastard. The Spartan guard grabs her just as she swings at Theron. Missing him, she spits in his direction. What Queen-like behavior. They hold her back, as she pulls at their arms, struggling to free herself. The room watches, frozen by the spectacle before them. You will soon feel nothing! Remove her from the chamber before she infects her son with her inglorious and shabby self. Gorgo throws one of the guardsmen off her, spinning behind the other she draws his short blade, kicking him clear and with one quick step buries the blade deep into Theron's midsection. I am a Spartan Queen, need I remind you. Theron buckles, his weight brought forward onto Gorgo's bloody hands, still holding the blade. She cuts across his waistline and from beneath his elaborate frock ... Xerxes' face forged clearly upon them for all to see. It seems every man does have his price! Gorgo leans down and whispers softly into Theron's ear. 91. When your bones are dust, my son will be King. She twists the short blade deeper into Theron. Their eyes lock. This will not be over quickly. You will not enjoy it. She remembers his cruelty. I am not your Queen. With those words she twists the blade out. Theron falls into a pile of his own blood and entrails. The Council members stand around her, some sift through the Persian gold, nodding at the traitor's death. But most stand in awe and admire their Queen.

Silence, save the heartbeat of the Spartans to his back. I beg you. Now carried on the back of Persian slaves, Xerxes and his throne are brought forth for the Spartan line to see.

Scene Action: Seagulls hover on ocean breeze. Delicate feathers ripple with the wind. And now as then, it is not fear that grips him, only a restlessness. A heightened sense of things. The pitted and dented surface of the King's helmet. A bead of sweat rolls down Leonidas' neck. The hem of his tattered crimson cape pushed lightly by the wind, brushing a pattern into the sand at his feet. DILIOS (V. 0.) The sea-borne breeze coolly kissing the sweat at his chest and neck. Gulls cawing, complaining even as they feast on the thousands of floating dead. 10,000 arrows shiver under the tension of drawn bows. The razor teeth and black eyes of the Immortals fight and jostle to lower spears and draw sabers, barely able to contain their bloodlust. 94. The steady breathing of the 300 boys at his back ... ready to die for him without a moment's pause. Every one of them ... WE MOVE ACROSS the battered shields of the 300. Clear eyes peer from bronze helmets. DILIOS (V. 0.) ... ready to die. Finally Leonidas exhales deeply and slowly reaches for his helmet. The Persian General watching, under growing tension. Xerxes rising from his throne to better see his enemy's surrender. DILIOS (V. 0.) His helmet is stifling ... Leonidas' helmet strikes the ground bluntly. ... his shield is heavy. Leonidas shrugs off his SHIELD and it RATTLES to his feet. Your spear. Leonidas lets his gaze run along the length· of his spear past its ragged tip, past even the Persian General to the hunched figure crouching among the legs and shields of the Immortals. You there, Ephialtes. The misshapen eye darts to avoid the King's gaze, then chances a look to Leonidas. The two hold each other's stare for a moment. May you live forever. The moment is broken. Your spear, Leonidas. The Spartan King looks back down to his hand, clenched around the weapon. He slowly opens his hand and looks back at the Persian General, letting the SPEAR fall, landing with a dusty CLANK! 95. He looks one last time to Xerxes standing atop his golden litter. Behind 10 rows of his bloodthirsty Immortals. Noting the wind as it dances with the black banners at the back of Xerxes' throne. WE SEE bronze strike the earth as Leonidas falls to his knees. His hands go to the rocky soil just in front of him. His head slowly bowing, his eyes close. FLASHBACK - EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD6767 Leonidas and his son compare the size of their hands.

Complete Content: Seagulls hover on ocean breeze. Delicate feathers ripple with the wind. And now as then, it is not fear that grips him, only a restlessness. A heightened sense of things. The pitted and dented surface of the King's helmet. A bead of sweat rolls down Leonidas' neck. The hem of his tattered crimson cape pushed lightly by the wind, brushing a pattern into the sand at his feet. DILIOS (V. 0.) The sea-borne breeze coolly kissing the sweat at his chest and neck. Gulls cawing, complaining even as they feast on the thousands of floating dead. 10,000 arrows shiver under the tension of drawn bows. The razor teeth and black eyes of the Immortals fight and jostle to lower spears and draw sabers, barely able to contain their bloodlust. 94. The steady breathing of the 300 boys at his back ... ready to die for him without a moment's pause. Every one of them ... WE MOVE ACROSS the battered shields of the 300. Clear eyes peer from bronze helmets. DILIOS (V. 0.) ... ready to die. Finally Leonidas exhales deeply and slowly reaches for his helmet. The Persian General watching, under growing tension. Xerxes rising from his throne to better see his enemy's surrender. DILIOS (V. 0.) His helmet is stifling ... Leonidas' helmet strikes the ground bluntly. ... his shield is heavy. Leonidas shrugs off his SHIELD and it RATTLES to his feet. Your spear. Leonidas lets his gaze run along the length· of his spear past its ragged tip, past even the Persian General to the hunched figure crouching among the legs and shields of the Immortals. You there, Ephialtes. The misshapen eye darts to avoid the King's gaze, then chances a look to Leonidas. The two hold each other's stare for a moment. May you live forever. The moment is broken. Your spear, Leonidas. The Spartan King looks back down to his hand, clenched around the weapon. He slowly opens his hand and looks back at the Persian General, letting the SPEAR fall, landing with a dusty CLANK! 95. He looks one last time to Xerxes standing atop his golden litter. Behind 10 rows of his bloodthirsty Immortals. Noting the wind as it dances with the black banners at the back of Xerxes' throne. WE SEE bronze strike the earth as Leonidas falls to his knees. His hands go to the rocky soil just in front of him. His head slowly bowing, his eyes close. FLASHBACK - EXT. SPARTAN COURTYARD6767 Leonidas and his son compare the size of their hands. The King's rough palm is barely covered by the entire soft hand of his son. The boy laughs. His eyes smiling. Soft light moves through leaves, laughing with the boy as he marvels at his father's hands.

Scene Name: EXT. SPARTAN FIELD6969
Scene Action: Gorgo sleeps in waist-high golden hay. Leonidas with the stem of yellowed grass lays next to her. He traces the contour of her cheek, she slowly swats at it. He continues down her neck, his eyes lost in her form. The nape of her neck, her collarbone, her black hair curly against the golden stalks of hay. Tickled, she opens her groggy eyes and seeing her husband, softly smiles.

Scene Name: EXT. HOT GATES - DAY - PRESENT7070
Scene Action: Leonidas, eyes closed, lets the faintest of smiles fade, then with head still down, calls ... STELIOS!! From behind the kneeling King, shields part and in two crushing strides, young Stelios leaps, spear in hand, from the cover of his Spartan brothers. Planting a foot on his King's back, he flies at the Persian General and, still in the air, he thrusts. Ribs part and sever. The exiting blood sprays into the eyes of nearby Immortals as the General withers under the blow. Leonidas snatches his own spear and, rising, loads for mighty throw. Xerxes bares his teeth in anger at the defiant King. 96. Slaughter them!!! The air goes thick with wood shafts, feathers and steel. Leonidas does not see the black banners at the back of Xerxes' throne fall with the lull in the wind. The only sound is that of countless ARROWS POUNDING into BRONZE SHIELDS, like hard rain on a metal roof. Through this barrage, Leonidas gathers every ounce of his strength. His helmet was stifling. It narrowed his vision ... target. ... and he must see far. The Spartan King's muscles pull the spear forward as around him the Persian spindles cut his children down. His shield was heavy. It threw off his balance. Leonidas lets his spear fly as one after another, arrows settle into him. His target is far away. The spear of Leonidas flies against the current of incoming arrows as the King cries out! XERXES... DIE! Dozens of arrows strike Leonidas at once. His men fall fighting. Leonidas draws his sword, struggling to free it from its sheath as arrow after arrow punches through limb and sinew. The old ones say we Spartans are descended from Hercules himself. Leonidas falls back upon the body of another of his fallen brothers. He then pushes himself back to his knees. 97. Bold Leonidas gives testament to our bloodline. His roar is long and loud. As Leonidas cries out in his glory, his spear silently out, away from the dying Spartans. It soars in a straight line. Its shadow snaking up the ornate carpet of Xerxes' throne. The God King does not move. He can only watch, wide-eyed as the spear of Leonidas, thrown as his fin.al act, grazes his cheek. A small spray of blood flies from Xerxes' face as the spear sticks into the back of the golden throne. The assembled host of Persian generals gasps in awe at the sight of the God King's spilled blood, divine no more. The unquenchable bloodlust of the Immortals rises to a fevered pitch as they bring to bear their entire arsenal of spears, arrows, swords and lances against the Spartans who fight on as they die. The Captain charges forward out of ranks. Dozens of arrows finding their mark in his back and chest. Yet, he does not fall. Leonidas watches helpless as one of the Immortals plunges a spear into the Captain's chest. The Captain takes hold of it, dropping shield and spear, pulling it into his own body, moving close to the Immortal who wields it. As life ebbs from him, he grips the Immortal's skull and twists it, snapping the neck with an audible crunch. The Immortal falls beneath him. The Captain rolls off, snapping the arrows that protrude from his body. Astinos ... He exhales deeply and dies, his son's name still on his lips. Xerxes puts a hand to his bleeding face. Overcome, he collapses to his throne. Leonidas struggles to reach Stelios. The two fight on... side by side with broken blades and useless shields, hacking at the relentless Immortals. 98. Through a horn of human bone, signaling the Immortals to fall back so as not to be cut down by their own archers. Exhausted and mortally wounded, Stelios and the King crawl back among the handful of still living Spartans. Endless scores of fresh archers take up positions on hillside and boulders, surrounding on all sides that which remains of the Intrepid 300. Stelios, through labored breath, his own blood-running into his eyes, calls to his King. Just feet away. My King. Each breath pain rising from within him. It's an honor to die at your side. Leonidas rises looking down at Stelios. It's an honor to have lived at yours. Countless archers bend bows as if the very earth around the dwindling Spartan ranks was not made of stone, scrub grass and cliff, but of bent ash, cat gut, and hungry iron arrow tips. We are CLOSE TO Leonidas' lips, chapped and splattered with dark blood. A Persian Commander nods to the herald. He inhales deeply. Leonidas is calm. His voice lowers. My Queen ... my wife. move, a whisper of reverence. My love ... The arrows are released as one. The lethal dark cloud races across the rugged and bloody battlefield. Stelios narrows his eyes and with his last breath, stands next to his King. The ARROWS STRIKE a single ... 99.

Scene Name: EXT. SPARTA HAYFIELD - DAY7373
Scene Action: At the edge of the city. Gorgo stands waist-deep in the amber hay, it moves around her, pushed and slanted by a late summer wind. The sun is low in the West. Gorgo has come to this spot many times. Her brown eyes scanning the low hills. A figure appears at the edge of the field. The light coming over his back as he moves toward her. His shadow loosely moves among the hay before him. He walks. Shield rutted and the cut bronze has peeled back to reveal oak. His helmet is dented and tarnished. The dried blood on his makeshift eye patch. He stands before his Queen alone. Her eyes a thousand questions. They share a silent moment of grief. She knows without word the fate of her husband. He does not reach into pocket or pouch. He simply raises his hand from his hip, turns his palm upward and opens it. There resting in the cut and calloused hand of Dilios is the wolf tooth necklace. Gorgo holds out her hands. Eyes welling. Dilios lets it fall then closes his hands around hers. He squeezes gently. She looks down and away. Her face binding in grief. Dilios watches her, feeling his own pain. He moves on, leaving her framed by the waving grass. Her body begins to shake. She drops to her knees. Her nose runs, all her Spartan reserve lost. son, Pleistarchos, runs, hay brushing at his knees as he rushes to his mother's side. Dilios turns watching from a distance. Pleistarchos reaches her, they embrace. Gorgo's face red and wet with tears as she looks at him, seeing her husband's eyes. Her love. She then takes the leather necktie and places it over her son's head. He bows, letting it come to rest at his chest. 100. His small fingers touching it. Pleistarchos puts his hand on his mother's face, gently wiping away her tears. Dilios watches as the dark figures in the bright hay embrace again. He nods silently to himself and turns.

Scene Action: Dilios still bloodied from battle, chin down, brow knitted. Lives each moment again. His voice ECHOING from the stone walls. Dilios stands at the center of the round room. Remember us ... as simple an order as a King can give. Remember why we died. The faces of the Spartan gallery are riveted. This is the very reason why this room was built. For he did not wish tribute or song, nor monuments, nor poems of war and valor. His wish was simple. Remember us ... He said to me ... that it was his hope should any free soul come across that place.

Scene Name: EXT. CAMPFIRES OF WAR - CLOSE ON DILIOS' FACE - DAWN7676
Scene Action: Firelight and the blue ambience of dawn mix. And so my King died, and so my brothers died, barely a year ago ... All around the fire now stand, ready for war, capes the color of blood, helmets and shields surround Dilios. Long I pondered my King's cryptic talk of victory. Time has proven him wise. Dilios begins to push through the Spartan warriors. They follow him from the fire. For from free Greek to free Greek the word was spread that bold Leonidas and his three hundred, so far from home, laid down their lives not just for Sparta ... way for him as he moves slowly, taking time to clasp shoulder with hand, meeting eyes with nods. ... but for all Greece and the promise this country holds. 102. Shields are pulled aside and from a wall of fresh bronze, with dawn breaking in fingers of golden light, Dilios steps out in front of the Spartan line. He strides slowly with confidence along the barrier of shields. A forest of spears reach back into the distance, pointing skyward. A young SQUIRE hands Dilios his shield and spear. Eyes burn with battle lust as Dilios, never far from this tableau of Spartan bronze, continues. Now, here on this rugged patch of Greece called Plataea, Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!!! Haaawooo! A cry like rolling thunder spreading across the Spartan ranks. LOWFLUTES begin to play a haunting melody, joined by slow rhythmic DRUMMING of SPEAR on SHIELD. Dilios spins, pointing with spear out across the barren landscape that lay before him. Just there ... the barbarians huddle. Sheer terror gripping tight. Their hearts with icy fingers knowing full well what merciless horror they suffered at the spears and swords of 300 ... Dilios turns back to the line of men. It disappears into the distance on both sides of him. ... yet they stare now across the plain at 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000 free Greeks. Again he is answered with a thunderclap. over the rolling hills. Thousands upon thousands of Spartan shields blaze with the rising sun. The enemy outnumber us a paltry three to one. Good odds for any Greek. 103. Dilios nods into his helmet. He takes hold of his spear and shield, melting back into the phalanx. This day we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny. We usher in a future brighter than anything we can imagine!! Dilios lowers his chin, gripping tightly the leather on his shield and as one in rhythm with the flutes, the spears of the Spartan war machine drop into position. Give thanks, men, to Leonidas and the brave 300. His eyes narrow, his teeth clench. Muscle and will become one. To Victory!!! CAPES SNAPPING behind them, the GROUNDSHAKING. Feet pound and churn the earth to dust and as it thunders TOWARD us, a razor-sharp spear tip just PASSES us, we TRAVEL DOWN its length TO the Hoplites' eyes, full of hate, glinting inside bronze, and then a shield FILLS OUR VIEW.
