Scene Action: LEONARD, WOLOWITZ AND PENNY ARE ARRANGING TAKEOUT FOOD. Let's see, Raj is the Kung Pao Chicken. I'm the dumplings. Yes, you are. Creepy, Howard. Creepy good or creepy bad? Who's the shrimp with lobster sauce? (REACHING FOR THE That would be me. Come to papa, you un-kosher delight. (TO PENNY) I'm talking to the food. Sit over there. Sorry I'm late. (TO PENNY) Sit over there. PENNY MOVES. SHELDON SITS DOWN AND WIPES HIS HANDS WITH A Baby Wipe? 2. Why do you have-- LEONARD/WOLOWITZ No, don't ask! / No, don't, don't. I'll tell you why. I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers. I thought blowers were more sanitary. LEONARD/WOLOWITZ No, no, stop. / Why? Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague-infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry. Oh. (TO LEONARD) Well that was unpleasant. We tried to stop you. Someday I'll learn. Guys, I have the most amazing news. I got-- HE SEES PENNY. HE TRIES TO CONTINUE, BUT HE CAN'T.

PENNY TAKES HER DUMPLINGS AND CROSSES TO THE DOOR, GIVING Goodbye you poor strange little man. She's so considerate. So what's your news? Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper Belt? Oh sure, 2008NQ-Sub-17. Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People Magazine is naming me one of their "thirty under thirty" to watch. LEONARD/WOLOWITZ That's incredible, Raj. / Congratulations. Excuse me, thirty what under thirty what to watch what? What is wrong with you, dude? Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields. If I had a million guesses, I never would have gotten that. 4. It's pretty cool. They've got me in with a guy who's doing something about hunger in Indonesia. Ending it? Let's hope. And a psychotherapist who's using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film "Juno." Oh, I'd so do her. You'd do the dolphins. Do I get an honorable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used? Sorry, that's not part of my compelling and heartwarming personal narrative. What's your narrative? I am a humble boy from New Delhi who overcame poverty and prejudice to reach for the stars. Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist. He drives a Bentley. It's a lease. I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included? Peer review? It's People Magazine. People picked me. 5. What people? The people from People. Yes, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials? How are they qualified? What makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty? (STRUGGLES FOR AN ANSWER, Boy, I'll bet Ellen Page's friends aren't giving her this kind of crap. Are you proud of yourself? In general, yes.

Come on, we're going to apologize to Raj and invite him to dinner. Apologize for what? He came over last night with some pretty good news and we weren't very supportive, some of us less so than others. What Leonard's trying to say is you were a colossal asshat. Oh, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive. Really? Do tell. How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister gave our father a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug and frankly, the man coasted until the day he died. 7. if this People Magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?

I have status? What's my status? Less than mine, more than theirs. Oh, that's great, but you really don't have to go to any trouble. How about I put you in Von Gerlich's old office? I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger. Done. Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbein's office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe. Yes, but I have status and status trumps dibs. Hold on a second. (TO GABLEHAUSER) He gets a new office and I can't even get paper towels for the men's room? Sheldon. Oh, damn. This is hard. 11. Let me explain something to you, gentlemen. What do you think the business of this place is? LEONARD/SHELDON/WOLOWITZ Science. Money. Money that pays for our linear accelerators and particle detectors and those hunched-over immigrant women who clean our offices at night. Well now, hang on, a couple of 'em are muy caliente.

(THEN TO KOOTHRAPPALI) Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the president's dining room? I didn't even know there was a president's dining room. Up till now, you weren't supposed to.

There's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday. And you guys aren't going? (TO THE GUYS) I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not going to be there to support him? No, a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered was plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind. That would be cool. I'd go to that reception. Come on, this is huge. Raj is gonna be in People Magazine and he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters! Would you like to come with me? 16. Of course I would. I'd be honored to.

Look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them. "Anything for a green card dot com." I'll lend you my username. It's "Wealthy Big Penis." You're joking. Hey, you gotta make it easy for 'em. They're just learning English. Pass. So you're just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Apu from the Kwik-E-Mart. 20. It's not a date. And that's racist. It can't be racist. He's a beloved character on "The Simpsons." Let's just eat. I want to go to sleep soon so I can get an early start on being miserable tomorrow. Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded? Yes. Even though the menu description specifies shredded? Yes. Brown rice, not white? Yes. Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard? Yes. Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market? Yes. Good. (THEN) What took you so long? 21. Just sit down and eat. Fine. SHELDON OPENS HIS CONTAINER AND LOOKS INSIDE, THEN PUTS IT IN All right, it's shredded. What do you want me to do? I want you to check before you accept the order. I'm sorry. Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight? He's not going to have intercourse with Penny. Then there's no excuse for this chicken. You know, the situation with Koothrappali brings to mind a story from my childhood. Oh goody, tales from the panhandle. That's northwest Texas. I'm from east Texas, the Gulf region. Home to many Vietnamese shrimpers. Do they feature in your story? 22. No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery Ward delivery van ran over our family cat, Lucky. Lucky? Yes, Lucky. He's irony impaired. Move on. Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue. While others mourned Lucky, I realized his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion I could snuggle with at night and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command. So, not a puppy. Please. Nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin. A griffin? Yes, half eagle, half lion. And mythological. Irrelevant. I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Of course, my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them. 23. Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy a good lion semen story, but what's your point? My point is if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort. You want to breed a new friend? That's one option. But consider wonderful work with artificial intelligence. You combine that with some animatronics from the Imagineers over at Disney and next thing you know, we're playing Halo with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln. Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way, but... you're insane. That may well be, but the fact is it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people. For the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens. (TO WOLOWITZ) And I'm not insane. My mother had me tested. If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust, a guy who has your back. And he should have a lot of money and live in a cool place down at the beach where we could throw parties. 24. And he should share our love of technology. And he should know a lot of women. Let's see, money, women, new friend is going to be Iron Man. THEY NOD, CONTINUE EATING FOR A BEAT. Don't you think he'd be all over Penny? You're right. Iron Man's out.

Look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them. "Anything for a green card dot com." I'll lend you my username. It's "Wealthy Big Penis." You're joking. Hey, you gotta make it easy for 'em. They're just learning English. Pass. So you're just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Apu from the Kwik-E-Mart. 20. It's not a date. And that's racist. It can't be racist. He's a beloved character on "The Simpsons." Let's just eat. I want to go to sleep soon so I can get an early start on being miserable tomorrow. Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded? Yes. Even though the menu description specifies shredded? Yes. Brown rice, not white? Yes. Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard? Yes. Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market? Yes. Good. (THEN) What took you so long? 21. Just sit down and eat.
