SCENE 1:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. ANIMAL PEN - DAY11
Scene Action: We are outside of a smallish animal pen. It sits in back of some wooden structures. The build and design is that of early 19th century American. It would pass for urban and commercial as opposed to agrarian. Within the pen we see SEVERAL SHEEP grazing. Into the pen walks a BUTCHER. He is a white man in his mid- forties. Without any particular regard he takes up one of the sheep, and wrestles it into a shack-like structure.

Scene Name: INT. ABATTOIR - LATER22
Scene Action: The shack is a smallish abattoir. We see the Butcher sitting on a bench next to the sheep. With sheers in hand, the Butcher clears the wool from the sheep. Once the sheep is clean, in a very matter of fact manner, the Butcher binds the sheep's rear legs, slits its throat, then hangs it upside down allowing for the animal to bleed out. The butcher then pulls the intestine from the animal immediately after slaughter while the gut is still hot. These bundles are put into large containers and await collection by the DRESSER.

SCENE 5:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON55
Scene Action: 2. The String Maker walks the package along the streets of Saratoga, New York. It is best known as the location that British General John Burgoyne surrendered to American General Horatio Gates at the end of the Battles of Saratoga on October 17, 1777, often cited as the turning point for the United States during the American Revolutionary War. The town line is formed by the Hudson River and is the border of Washington County. Fish Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River, is the outflow of Saratoga Lake. It is a fairly modern township, but in the middle 1800s it is far from pristine. THERE IS MUD AND MANURE EVERYWHERE, AND IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ANYTHING CLEAN. This state, however, is the norm for the era and goes uncommented upon. The String Maker arrives to a TOWNHOUSE. Using a KNOCKER that Mr. Northup? Are you there Mr. Northup?

Scene Name: INT. TOWNHOUSE - STUDY - LATER66
Scene Action: We are close on a PAIR OF HANDS. BLACK HANDS. They unwrap the package and display the strings. WE CUT TO the hands stringing a violin. It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice. WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mein and manner, is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual. Someone who has known manual labor in his time. Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously. As he does, we make a

SCENE 7:

Scene Name: INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING77
Scene Action: We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being thrown with the confines of a fairly stately house. In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means. 3. The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL. Most likely they would be dancing "the reel of three," in which, as the name implies, three dancers weave in and out of one another, completing a figure 8 pattern on the floor, usually in six or eight bars of music. The music they are dancing too is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude. Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by thanks and congratulations by the group. It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

SCENE 8:

Scene Name: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING88
Scene Action: It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her "finest attire" is ANNE; Solomon's wife. A few years younger than Solomon. She is lighter in color than Solomon as well. We see also the ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed kids. Anne straightening up the children. She finishes, she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait. They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer. He stands, and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires well and provided for. He goes to his children, and hands each a coin. He moves, then, to Anne. Gives her a kiss on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

SCENE 9:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. STREET - DAY99
Scene Action: Solomon and his family are now out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga. 4. The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily though not always completely with the whites. We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south and despite the fact the blacks are slaves, they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking, as they trail their masters. Among the slaves, we see one in particular; JASPER. As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they make their way INTO A STORE. His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious. With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward Parker's store. Clearly his intent is to have dealings with the Northup's.

SCENE 10:

Scene Name: INT. STORE - LATER1010
Scene Action: We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER, a supplier of Mr. Parker. Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup. Though little is stated, their is clearly familiarity among them. With money in hand the Northup children move quickly about the store looking for items to purchase. At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the book If you would, Mr. Northup, sign our condolence book. My hope is to find a way to forward it to the Widow Harrison. Sad days for the nation. But brighter times ahead. As Anne looks over some silks and fabrics, Solomon eyes a new 5. May I? It would be my pleasure. Could I trouble you for a waltz, sir? Solomon does a quick tuning of the instrument, then into a waltz; lively and well played. The Elizabeth and Margaret clasp hands and dance. There is laughter and smiles. As Solomon plays, Jasper enters the store. He stands for a moment, again in seeming admiration of Solomon. While far from pathetic, Jasper is the definition of a subservient man. As Solomon concludes to the applause of Parker and the Suh -- A word, suh? I could not help none but take note of yahself and yah family as yah made yah way. My congratulations to yah. Yah Missus and chil'ren be very handsome 'n must be'a great regard. My name, suh, is Jasper. I am travelin' to Saratoga with my massa. Massa Fitzgerald. And I will insist to yah, suh, that I am well provided fo'. Yah can see that jus by my adornments. And I never want for no meal or 'fo warmth at night. Massa Fitzgerald is a fine man. Very fine. Jasper looks to Parker, then steps closer to Solomon and speaks a bit conspiratorially. The following comes from him 6. But it is my desire I should not spend my life in his servitude. It is my quiet desire that I should have a missus of my choosin', raise up young'n and provide 'fo 'em as I sees fit. It is a desire I keep inside me, and easily so, when I am south. Freedom at best a fleetin' notion. But on travels north, if I can be true; I can hardly contain my wantin' for liberty. I am anxious for it. I am anxious to escape. But I am anxious all the same of the punishment that would attend my recapture. My question to you, suh, is of the best and surest method of effecting my flight. The only answer I can give -- Watch your opportunities and strike for freedom. What opportunities? And how shall I take advantage of them? Solomon isn't sure how to respond. It's easy to speak of freedom, but not how it is gained. WE HEAR THE BELL AT THE DOOR. It's Jasper's Master. He's stern, clearly displeased. Jasper! Jasper, come along. (to Parker) I apologize for any intrusion, sir. No, intrusion. Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a response from a Good day, sir.

SCENE 11:

Scene Name: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING1111
Scene Action: 7. The family now sits around the dinner table, the meal mostly finished. Solomon, the very definition of a man in repose - sits at the head of the table reading from a NEWSPAPER. He reads to the rest of the family solemn news of the funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President Harrison. "Thus has passed away from earth our late President. His voice was still fresh in the ears of his countrymen when it was hushed in death. The tongue of calumny had not time to poison his fame. He has passed from the praise of men to receive the plaudit of his heavenly Father. Let us in this bereavement bow meekly to the divine will, and hear the voice of the Sovereign of the Sovereign saying be still and be with God." A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat. Will you read it again? Solomon starts from the top of the article. "During the morning, from sunrise, the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust. Our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man. One who was by the wishes of a large majority of our people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift. William Henry Harrison, the first chief magistrate who has died during his term of service."

Scene Action: Solomon is now out for a stroll. As he crosses near MR. MOON'S TAVERN, he passes two men, two in particular, who and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes him, slightly effeminate. Call the Devil's name -- There he is now. Mr. Northup -- I have two gentlemen who should make your acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and Hamilton. Sir. 9. Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals, and I was just this very moment telling them that Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin. He was indeed. Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty, may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?

Scene Name: INT. MR. MOON'S TAVERN - LATER1616
Scene Action: We make a jump cut into the tavern. Solomon, Brown and Hamilton are sitting at a table. Brown and Hamilton drink lightly. Solomon abstains. A circus? That is our usual employee. The company currently in the city of Washington. Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel. It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed. Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man. Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners. Men of great strength -- And Mr. Brown himself; an internationally renowned pantomimist. You are too kind. As your talents are too great. 10. We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make an excursion northward for the purpose of seeing the country, our expenses paid by an occasional exhibition. The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon -- Yes. We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our entertainments. Men of true talent seemingly in short supply. As we were discussing our predicament, Mr. Moon suggested we make acquaintance with you, praising your skills at every opportunity. Gentlemen -- We offer this, desperate as we are; If you could accompany us as far as New York -- We would give you one dollar for each day's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances. In addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga. An opportunity to see the country with the occasional exhibition from which to accrue expenses. If there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer -- (enthusiastically) I will give more than consideration. I will agree. Immediately. The payment offered is enticement enough, as is my desire to visit the metropolis. 11. We are delighted, sir. So delighted. Though we would add that our travel plans-- We would like to depart with haste. However, it is understood if there are arrangements you need to attend to. As luck would have it, my wife and children are traveling. I will write her of our plans, then we may go.

Scene Name: INT. PUB - EVENING2020
Scene Action: We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. This is the locale at which Brown and Hamilton are currently engaged in putting on one of their "entertainments." We see Hamilton at the door, collecting receipts. WHAT LITTLE AUDIENCE THERE IS, IS ALREADY IN PLACE. There is nothing more for Hamilton to collect. Brown is at the head of the space entertaining a PARSE AUDIENCE AND NOT OF "SELECT CHARACTER." Solomon provides the music on his violin. As Solomon plays, Brown goes through and act of pantomiming the throwing of balls, dancing on a rope, frying pancakes in a hat, causing invisible pigs to squeal. Basically it's some pretty lame stuff. Not nearly the calibre one would expect to find as part of a great "carnival."

As Solomon plays, Brown goes through and act of pantomiming the throwing of balls, dancing on a rope, frying pancakes in a hat, causing invisible pigs to squeal. Basically it's some pretty lame stuff. Not nearly the calibre one would expect to find as part of a great "carnival."

SCENE 21:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - LATER2121
Scene Action: Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected. If it's not anything, it's next to it. I have not seen an audience so sparse -- Not an additional tip from a one of them. They expect to be entertained for nothing. And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for. It's the national mood. There's too much grief to make room for frivolity. 13. I think we won't see a true audience until Washington. We should make it our objective to return with all due speed. My sincerest apologies, Solomon. No need. You were promised opportunity, and you were given none. The opportunity is with the circus. A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect? But the circus bills itself. True. It arrives to each town with a hoopla and leaves with a flourish. Very true. And with the summer season approaching it's tour will be vigorous. I have told you of the circus with which we are connected. Creatures from the darkest of Africa. Acrobats from the Orient who-- You have described it, yes. Magical. It is simply magical. A constant whirlwind of sights and sounds. All witnessed by a crush of humanity, excitement spilling from their hearts. Yes. We need to return immediately to Washington. Solomon -- I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold -- would you consider making the trip with us? 14. Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea. I realize our promises have fallen short to this point, but I can guarantee high wages and an enthusiastic audience. Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better. Hear, hear. And more importantly you would build your own name and following. 12 Years a Slave 05.18.11 13. The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations. An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward. Now would be the time. With your family away, an opportunity presents itself. Said as fellow artists as well as a businessman. Well worth the effort at least. Solomon considers -- Clearly their aggrandizing has an effect on Solomon. You present a flattering representation. How can I say no? Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I cannot recall being so excited. There is a practical concern. If you are to continue one with us you should obtain your free papers. Not necessary. 15. Here in New York, no. But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution -- It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being. Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later. We'll go to the Customs House in the morning, then travel on. Good business all around.

Finished, the Official walks the ledger back to a row of shelves, and replaces the book among MANY, MANY others. Though Solomon gives it no thought, it's a little daunting to consider how precarious his freedom is once consigned to this ledger.

All to you. That -- it's far more than my wages amount to. An advance from the circus. I cannot tell you -- I honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when I described your abilities. He was fairly overcome with excitement. You should have invited him to sup with us. I did. I did, but so many preparations before the company is to depart. Gentlemen-- Of which I have other news, only slightly distressing. Our departure is delayed by a day-- Oh, Dear -- You have already been far to generous. But only a day. All the confusion with tomorrow's procession makes departure difficult. Solomon, if you can tolerate us a day more -- 17. Oh, yes, Solomon, you did want to see the city. And how could we make our way without seeing the great man pass? One more day, Solomon. Will you stay on? What can I say but yes?

Remember him with a drink. Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their canters to drink. 18. Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same. Another. Our departed President deserves all the salutation we can imbibe. Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well.

I'm afraid that Brown and I haven't brought you much luck. But rough waters bring smooth sailing. Eventually they do. So -- so sorry -- 19. Shhh. We won't hear it. We won't. Let him sleep. Hmm. A good night's sleep. And tomorrow -- tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again. Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of Hamilton! Nothing more we can do for him. Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE DISTRESSED. It's a wonder if he can make it through the night.

Gingerly, unsteadily, Solomon makes his way through the space. The hotel seeming oddly and creepily empty at the moment. Eventually, Solomon arrives to a KITCHEN where he comes upon some "COLORED" SERVANTS. Solomon does everything in his power to right himself. Despite being sweaty and covered in his own bile, Solomon works actually struggles to make himself seem presentable. Water, please. May I have water? A FEMALE SERVANT pours a glass of water which Solomon gulps down, spilling as much on himself as actually taking in. More, sir? It's sufficient. 20. As he came in, Solomon makes the same effort to propel himself from the space.

From the noises he makes, Solomon sounds as though he's in a fever dream. As Solomon reels, THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM OPENS. THREE FIGURES ENTER. Backlit as they are, we cannot discern their features.

Scene Name: INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING3131
Scene Action: Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove. As Solomon rises he sees that he is in chains, his HANDS CUFFED, the chain running to a bolt in the ground and his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic. He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free. After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed state he remains.

Scene Action: 21. Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the door -- footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter JAMES BURCH who runs the slave pen and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer. As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to Solomon's Well, my boy, how yah feel now? Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he can I am Solomon Northup. I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York. The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free. I have papers. You have no right whatsoever to detain me-- Yah not any-- And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong. Yah no free man. And yah ain't from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia. A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding. Yah ain't a free man. Yah nothin' but a Georgia runaway. Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare. They are clearly at an intellectual standoff. Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH. Radburn exits the room, his physical absence is a long moment. But all the while WE CAN HEAR Radburn's footfall and his rummaging in the next room. The unseen is disquieting. 22. paddle - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also carries a whip. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each. Burch Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia. Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say nothing of the kind. As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men, and roughly divested of his clothing. He is pulled over the bench, face downward. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS holding Solomon down in a bent position. Without preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly, no taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND BRUISES. This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort. Yah still insist yah a free man? I -- I insist -- Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave! Burch continues to strike, and strike -- This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP. Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon "breaks." Are yah slave? 23. No -- Are yah slave! Nothing from Solomon. Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping -- SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN Finally Burch can whip no more. As he pours sweat and sucks I don't want to hear any more shit about you bein' "entitled" to your freedom, about being kidnapped or anythin' whatever of the kind. I swear what yah jus' got'll pale to what ya'll receive. Taking up their instruments Burch exits. Radburn lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're; on the floor face down and back bleedin'. Sick. Make me sick. Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for? Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught. So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it? Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant. (to Robert) Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next. With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none. Help me! Someone help me! 24. If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon continues his plaintiff cry for assistance.

Scene Action: Radburn brings food into Solomon, the shriveled meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain Solomon. This time Radburn also has a SHIRT. Brought a shirt. That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters. Need something proper to wear. Solomon doesn't move for the clothing. Go'won. Put it on. With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty. There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine. Got no gratitude? Thank you -- Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see how things work out. Radburn starts to take the old shirt. No! It was from my wife. Rags and tatters. Rags and tatters. 26. Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him. Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He pushes the plate away rather than eat.

Radburn is present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD WATER. He throws water on the naked men. Go on. Warsh up. The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with A SINGLE HARSH BAR OF SOAP passed among them. The boy, too. Get him clean. Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall. Scrub now. Git 'em clean. Solomon scrubs harder. Randall, clearly cold and uncomfortable, begins to cry, becoming nearly inconsolable. Mama! Mama! Is she going to come? Hush him up! Quiet, please. Mama! Shut him up! 27. Your mother will come, I swear she will, but you must be silent. Please. Be silent! On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men.

Scene Action: Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another. At the moment Solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation. Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls should feel like little more than background noise. I believe now someone lay in wait for me. My drink was altered We are free men. They have -- they have no right to hold us. Solomon waits for a response from the others. They give none. We need a sympathetic ear. If we have an opportunity to explain our situation, it is impossible for me to believe men could be so unjust to detain us as slaves once the truth of our case is known. Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear? 28. The two men I journeyed with; Brown and Hamilton. I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment. I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place. They were not kidnappers. They were artists. They were performers. You know that? I -- I have no reason to-- You know for certain who they were? FLASHBACK4040 Very quickly, we get an MOS glimpse from Solomon's POV of BROWN PERFORMING BACK AT THE TAVERN. His act is shit, and with 20/20 hindsight perhaps it is even a bit shittier than we recall. The man an artist? Hardly.

Scene Name: EXT. YARD - CONTINUOUS4141
Scene Action: Solomon's got to reconcile that recollection of his. Brown sure wasn't a performer of any merit. More like a charlatan. As Solomon considers that fact, Clemens states whatever past we had -- well, that's done now. The reality to come is us being transported southward. New Orleans if I were to venture. After we arrive, we'll be put to market. Clemens Ray chokes a bit. The horrid fate waiting for them becoming quite clear to him. 29. Beyond that -- Well, once in a slave state I suppose there's only one outcome. John's anxiety grows. No. I don't say that to give you empty agitation -- For y'all. For y'all they ain't nothin' but that! But John was'n kidnapped. John bein' hold as debt, tha's all. Massa pay his debt, and John be redeemed-- Boy-- John is nearly beside himself with panic. Now John's -- John's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be. Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John. Massa take care of me. Massa take care. Mama! All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties; ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears." Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has to this point lived well. This is reflected in her airs and her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's half sister. As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly this is mother and child being reunited. As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches both her children. She is overcome with emotion. 30. My darlings. My sweet, sweet babes.

Scene Name: INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING4242
Scene Action: Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon who lends a sympathetic ear. Poor innocent things. They know nothing of the misery they are destined to endure. The years previous will have been bliss by comparison. I had my master's favor, do you understand? Above even his own wife, I had it. Do you know that he built a house for me? Built it only on the sole condition that I reside there with him. The added promise in time I would be emancipated. And for nine years he and I cohabited. And in that nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life. Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us. Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him. But Master Berry's daughter -- she always looked at me with an unkind nature. She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh. As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household. Eventually, I was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed. On our arrival, instead of being baptized into the family of the free, we were delivered into stricter bondage. If I had known what waited I would not have been brought here alive. I swear that. 31. Eliza looks to Solomon. But there is no response that comes easily on the heels of all that's been said. All they can do is share Eliza's lament. She turns to her children, says My poor children. My poor, poor babies. BLACK4343

Chief among them is ARTHUR, who fights viciously with his captors. His face swollen and covered with wounds and bruises. One side of it is a complete raw sore. "With all haste" is shoved down into the hold. Another among them is ROBERT, who is about 19 years of age. He, like Solomon, is quiet. And like Solomon as well we can tell there is much going on behind his eyes; a good deal of silent plotting. Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word spoken to Solomon or the others. With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way again. Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them. That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage he cannot express in words. 35. INT/EXT. ORLEANS - DAY5454 As the brig sails, the slaves are seated and huddle on deck.

In quiet defiance Robert doesn't say a word. Answer me! Know how to cook. Let me see your hands. Robert does as instructed and holds out his hands. The Captain looks them over. Clean enough. Get on to the galley and make yourself of use. Robert moves away as the Captain continues on to Solomon. Get up. Solomon doesn't move. The Captain is clearly getting tired of the mounting disrespect. He announces to the remaining The next one of you that refuses me will be bound and thrown overboard, I promise you that. Get up! Solomon rises. What can you do? 37. I play the fiddle. Got no need for that. What else? Some farm labor from my youth. As I young man I worked a gang that rebuilt a canal. As useless to me as fiddling. Jack of all trades and master of none. You can carry a load, can't you? Yes. Then do it. You'll haul from the hold to the galley, and clean it when you're done. Mr. Biddee, another for your charge.

Scene Name: INT. ORLEANS - HOLD - LATER5757
Scene Action: Down in the hold the slaves eat, pray. SOME ARE SEA SICK AND THEY THROW UP. Among all this, Arthur sits and talks with Solomon. They are removed from the others, as much as they can be, and they are conspiratorial as Arthur tells the tale of how he came to be a captive. 38. They was a gang of 'em. A true home on an unfamiliar street. Well, they set right upon me. For whatever reason, they seen me and think I was low fruit. No, suh. Was no such a thing. I commence to swingin'. The resonance of every blow again' 'em a reminder of the family I would never again see if'n they prevailed. I fought 'em. Fought those damned kidnappers until all my strength left me. Fought 'em right to they beat me senseless. And here I was drug, and here I was dumped. They got no right to me. I'm free. Free as them. Do you think we can make ourselves free again? Do you think we can escape? Arthur says nothing. He just gives a look to Solomon as if he's interested in listening to whatever Solomon has to say. The crew is fairly small. They don't seem particularly game. Do you think we can commandeer the ship? I know we git where we travelin', we'll wish we'd died tryin'. If we did take her, where'd we sail? New York harbor. can you get us there? I can make every effort. Arthur considers things for a moment. There's the Captain, the Mate -- I count six sailors. If we tried for them one by one -- 39. What would we do? Once we've seized the crew; what would we do with them? We kill 'em. This sinks in for a moment, but clearly it is the only way. How would we take them? First in the mornin'. We'd be on them before they knew what; quick and merciless. Captain and mate first. Waylay 'em, the others won't be given ta fight. They will if they know death waits for them. They won't know. The ones we don't kill right off, we tell 'em they can have their lives if they submit. Question of when. As soon as we can. As soon as tomorrow. Their guard is high. Oughta wait for when they're not suspecting. It's two weeks sail to New Orleans. In five days, six days -- All that much farther south. And they be all the more tired and incautious. Make the chore easier. Solomon considers this. It makes some sense. There remains, 40. We need a third. Even with luck on our side, two can't stand against eight. We have to bring another into the conspiracy. Arthur looks around at the other slaves. He is unimpressed by their nature. They's niggers. Born and bred slaves. Cringe at so much as a white man's look. Not one's got stomach enough fo the fight. Not a damn one. We need another. Two alone will not succeed. With three we are nearly guaranteed. Solomon looks among the slaves. There must be at least one more who's capable of mutiny. Clemens Ray? John? Doesn't seem that way.

Scene Name: EXT. NEW ORLEANS - PORT - DAY6767
Scene Action: The Orleans arrives to the port of New Orleans and docks. The port is one of the busiest in the young nation, vessels of every shape and size, and flying a variety of flags arrive here. On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded. It's a bit of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken and shouted. Two men among many are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans. They are WILLIAMS - Arthur's master and DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Williams. They both look like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is laid they bum rush the vessel, Williams yelling for Arthur. Arthur! Arthur! Arthur, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically, his master now represents "freedom." My master. Master Williams, sir! Master Williams! Arthur pulls on his chains for Williams, nearly pulling the other slaves with him. Davis is no nonsense about the situation. 44. Who is in charge of this vessel? I am the Captain. I am the solicitor of Mr. Jonus Williams. I have documentation verifying that the Negro named Arthur is his property. I know nothing of-- You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery. My duty is to transport goods. I am not responsible for their origin. Sir -- It's all right, Arthur. Your abductors have been arrested and confined -- (to the Captain) Remove these contraptions! Free him! Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Arthur hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child. It's all well, now, Arthur. You will return home with me. Consider this notice and warning. 45. Williams, Davis and Arthur head from the ship. Solomon rushes to the rail of the ship. He seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from Arthur and Williams. But there is none forthcoming. Williams and Arthur continue on - Arthur not so much as even looking back in Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight.

As they travel for the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery. These are not the visiting servants, such as Jasper was back in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage - herded like cattle, working in "chain gangs." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars. THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS THAT WERE LEFT UNTREATED, brands and are often missing limbs. Blacks are held in all kinds of shackles, from simple chains to elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked. Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of oppression in place.

The Customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth. At times a man or woman are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely. Randall is made to run, and jump by a PROSPECTIVE BUYER. Bob, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle. As this occurs, as a BUYER looks over a MALE SLAVE his back lightly scared. Freeman gives the Buyer the soft sell. Too few strokes is a sign they ain't been broken. Too many tells yah never will. This is a well tenderized nigger here. The Buyer is more curious in Randall. Your price for the boy? You see how fit he is. Like ripe fruit. He will grow into a fine nigger. Six hundred, and that's fair and final. I take him outside these gates I can name my price. Will you accept a note? 50. Please, sir, no. My baby boy, he's my baby. Please don't divide my family. Don't take my boy unless you take myself and my baby as well. Eliza, quiet! You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. The most faithful slave that has ever lived. There is no way that I will not serve, but I beg that you not take my child. How much for the lot? The woman is a value in herself. The child's a treasure. Three thousand. The Buyer considers, then demurs. I'll have the boy alone. Noooo! Please, God, no! As the Buyer writes out a note, Freeman pulls the crying Eliza away Randall. I will beat the nonsense from you. Come on, lad. They start away. Randall runs back, crying but endeavoring to Don't cry, mama. I will be a good boy. Don't cry. I will keep my head up, and I will look smart. I will always look smart. Freeman is wholly unmoved. He tears Randall away, thrusts him to the Buyer who then pulls the crying Randall from the room. 51. Mama! Mama! Nooooo! Noooo! family.

Freeman gives the Buyer the soft sell. Too few strokes is a sign they ain't been broken. Too many tells yah never will. This is a well tenderized nigger here. The Buyer is more curious in Randall. Your price for the boy? You see how fit he is. Like ripe fruit. He will grow into a fine nigger. Six hundred, and that's fair and final. I take him outside these gates I can name my price. Will you accept a note? 50. Please, sir, no. My baby boy, he's my baby. Please don't divide my family. Don't take my boy unless you take myself and my baby as well. Eliza, quiet! You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. The most faithful slave that has ever lived. There is no way that I will not serve, but I beg that you not take my child. How much for the lot? The woman is a value in herself. The child's a treasure. Three thousand. The Buyer considers, then demurs. I'll have the boy alone. Noooo! Please, God, no! As the Buyer writes out a note, Freeman pulls the crying Eliza away Randall. I will beat the nonsense from you. Come on, lad. They start away. Randall runs back, crying but endeavoring to Don't cry, mama. I will be a good boy. Don't cry. I will keep my head up, and I will look smart. I will always look smart. Freeman is wholly unmoved. He tears Randall away, thrusts him to the Buyer who then pulls the crying Randall from the room. 51. Mama! Mama! Nooooo! Noooo! family.

Eventually at the door to the yard appears Freeman with a lantern in hand. Bob is at his side. With no concern for its causation, Freeman is clearly displeased by the racket. Quiet! Sleep, now! What's the matter with y'all? Sleep! He looks to Bob. Make 'em sleep. Bob now wades into the field of slaves. He shoves and kicks Sleep now. C'mon, go on to sleep. Yah hear Massa Freeman? Sleep.

Scene Name: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - FLASHBACK8686
Scene Action: It is years prior. The odyssey that awaits Solomon cannot even begin to even enter his mind. Solomon is with his family - Anne, Elizabeth, Margaret and Alonzo. Solomon holds in his hand and up to the light of the window a SMALL, STAINED GLASS MEDALLION. Nothing too elaborate. Something a child would, and in fact has, made; a simple, colored flower. Five pedals surrounding a flower head. As light passes through the stained glass the colors resemble those of the previous scene. Though, at this moment, as he marvels at the gift from Elizabeth, there is much joy in his heart. You made it? Yourself? Nearly so. She had a little help around the fire. Nothing more. It's rather plain. Hush! It's beautiful. Precious. It is precious. May I wear it? It's for father! I can play the drum. A brief exhibition around Margaret's neck before I reclaim it. As Solomon fastens the medallion around Margaret's neck, Alonzo takes up a small drum and begins to beat it mercilessly as he runs around the room. Margaret strokes the medallion and smiles. 55. Do you like my drumming? I believe we have raised a master of fortissimo. I adore it. Will you fashion one for me? For me as well. Come, Margaret. Into the light. Elizabeth beckons Margaret closer to the window, Elizabeth holding up the medallion to the light. Anne remains close to Solomon as he stares at the light coming from the pendant. Lord -- Have I not always been faithful? Did I not put you above all else?

Yet one more physical reminder of all that he's been through even at this relatively short stage of his enslavement. As he sits, the door of the ward opens. Eliza is walked in and ushered over to a bed. She, too, has obviously survived the ordeal. But also, as with Solomon, she is now scared as well. Along with having lost a child, her illness seems to have had a substantial negative effect on not just her physical health, but Eliza's mental health as well. For a moment Solomon and Eliza just sit among the other recovering patients, waiting for what is to come next. BLACK9090

What is the price for the ones Harry, Platt and Eliza? Nine Hundred for Harry, a thousand for Platt; he is a nigger of talent. Seven hundred for Eliza. My fairest price, sir. You will exchange a note? As always, from you, Mr. Ford. Eliza, pulling Emily forward and putting her on urgent 57. Sir -- Sir, she is my baby. Stepping in, attempting to explain things. Sir, she watched as her only boy was sold off. If there is any way in your heart-- You will be quiet. To not separate them further, sir. The Lord almost took her with disease. If he would not separate Mother and Child, are any of us to do more? What is her price? (spitefully) I won't sell the girl. And you have no need for her. One so young will bring you no profit. Theys heaps 'n piles of money to be made of her. She is a beauty. One of the regular bloods, none of your thick-lipped, bullet heated, cotton picking niggers. Her child, man. For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least? My sentimentality stretches to the length of a coin. Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on 'em all? I will take them. Eliza grips Emily tight. 58. I will not go without her. You will not take her from me. AS if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Eliza. Please, don't. No! Take her out of here. Bob begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate. IT IS CLEARLY Keep her quiet. Bob tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her child as Emily does for her mother. There is no need. (to Solomon) Play something! Get the fiddle and play. As ordered, Solomon takes up Bob's fiddle and begins to play lightly. Play! Solomon begins to play harder and louder. Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing. Goddamn it, Bob, yah keep her quiet or it's yer damned hide I will take it out of! Bob pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head. It is an ugly, ugly scene.

The slaves are gathered on the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion. "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, Eliza sits off to the side self-secluded a bit weeping gently. 63. We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

Complete Content: It's Sunday morning. All of Ford's slaves are dressed with their "finest" clothes - brightly colored and as free as possible of defect. The slaves are gathered on the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion. "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.

Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious. This one was readin' aloud. Scripture, no less. This one claims it to be his. 65. It is. A gift from his Mistress. You condone this? I encourage it. As a Christian I can do no less. Any man who would allow his slaves to have a Bible is not fit to own a nigger. And any man who would allow a slave to read is dangerous. The Customer huffs off. Handing the book back to Sam, very Pay him no mind. There will always be men who don't understand the nature of God, nor His compassion. But the word of God applies to all, whites and niggers alike. In that you may take comfort.

The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. The distance from the mill to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially diminished-- "Materially diminished?" If we use the waterway. It's a scheme, Ford. Visionary, but a scheme. Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly. The passes are too narrow. I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow. Wide enough for a tub to traverse. Appears narrower to the eye; mostly obstructed by tree trunks. A team of niggers can clear it out. And you know what of transport and terra formin'? I labored repairing the Champlain canal, on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent. With my earnings I hired several efficient hands to assist me, and I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy. During the season I became perfectly familiar with the art and mysteries of rafting. (drily witty) Pity his qualifications exceed the work at hand -- But I supposes it's worthy of a try. 68. A waste of effort. It's Platt's effort to waste. (to Solomon) Get a team. Let's see what you can do.

He converses with CHAPIN who is the overseer on the plantation. As he waits, Solomon sees a figure in the near distances pulling up dead plants from the yard. The person is just far enough away Solomon can't clearly make out who it is. Recognition gradually comes to him. He yells to the person. Eliza -- The figure looks up. It is Eliza. She makes the LONG TRAVEL over to Solomon, moving slowly at a somnambulistic pace. As she nears, Solomon can see that Eliza looks weary and gaunt. She has grown feeble and emaciated, and is still in mourning for her children. There is no awareness in her eyes. It's Platt. It's Platt, Eliza. 72. A moment before Eliza, her faculties clearly slipping, recognizes Solomon. A bit, just a bit, of life and light return to her. Platt? You knew my babies. I did. Do you recollect how handsome little Emily was? And Randall -- Do you recall how he loved me more than anything? He did. I wonder if they are still living. I think they are still alive. A child would perish without their mother, a lesser child. But mine are too hearty. Would you say so? I would -- You've seen what strong constitutions they have. As vital and healthy as any children I've ever seen. They endure, and they would want the same of their mother. They would want her to-- Where are they? You say they endure, you say that they-- Eliza-- Then where are my children? Having returned, Tibeats calls to Solomon. His displeasure in 73. Platt! I must go. Solomon turns to head away. Eliza grabs him by the arm, and holds him fast as she becomes a bit crazed. You know where they are. Where? Eliza, unhand me. Damn it, Platt! Tibeats moves toward Solomon and Eliza. His fist is curled to do work. You know, tell me. Tell me where they are! Arriving to the pair, Tibeats wastes no time in throwing a quick but severe beating on Eliza. Done with that, he strikes Solomon hard across the face. Chapin intervenes. Tibeats. Enough. Your meaning is clear. Sweat, or stripes, nigger. You will bear sweat or you will wear stripes.

Do as told - yes, suh. No, suh - you'll do fine. But you show a spark of reasonin' behind yo eyes -- steel yourself for a lashin'. Ford wouldn't stand for him to give me such a beating. Not Massa Ford's no more. Yo time with him is o'er and done. And the Tanner's hain't never about. Put it out your head. Learn yourself ta be a proper nigger. BLACK120120

Eliza, stop! He goes to her, grabs her. Stop your wailing. Your sorrow will be the end of you. 76. She does not stop. As if to force the misery from her, Solomon strikes Eliza twice. Stop it! Stop! Have you stopped crying for your children? You make no outward sounds, but inside you; do you still weep and wail? Before you drift at night, do you not wonder where they are and if they prosper -- Solomon? If you do not, then you assuredly have been reduced to the nigger they are desirous of -- Solomon. This truth AND THE USE OF HIS TRUE NAME BY PATSEY strikes Solomon very directly. They may mourn differently, but he has not let go of his children.

SCENE 114:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. WEAVING HOUSE - LATER126126
Scene Action: As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Before even arriving to Solomon, his mein is one of belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober. I thought I told yah to commence puttin' on clapboards this morn'. Yes, master. I am about it. I have begun on the other side of the house. Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault. Didn't I tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin? Yes, master, and so I did; and Chapin said he would get another size for you, if you wanted them when he came back from the field. Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward Solomon Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed something! Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in no mood for Chapin. 78. I did as instructed. If there's something wrong, then its wrong with your instructions. Yah black bastard! Yah goddman black bastard! In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza to fetch a whip. Solomon looks around. He is alone other than RACHEL the cook and CHAPIN'S WIFE who, shocked by that which she witnesses, runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats marches back whip in hand. Strip yer clothes! Solomon does no such thing. Strip! I will not. With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down, Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the handle again and again and again. Yew will not live ta see another day nigger! This is yer last, I swear it! Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats. Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches. Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and then 79. Murder! It's murder! Lord, God, help me. God be merciful! Chapin comes riding in from the field fast and hard. Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the ground. What is the matter? Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of dignity Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me. What's the matter with the nails? They're -- they're too large. I am overseer here. I told Platt to take them and use them, and if they were not of the proper size I would get others on returning from the field. It is not his fault. Besides, I shall furnish such nails as I please. Do you understand that, Mr. Tibeats? Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist. This ain't half over. I will have my satisfaction. Tibeats moves off toward the house. Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee. Anxiety mounts on his features. A moment more, and Tibeats exits the house. He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to fetch him. Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest. 80. Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble. Do not stir. Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever. Your master is a rascal, and has left on no good errand. But if you run there is no protecting you. Sir-- If you run, Platt, there is no protecting you. Rachel! Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen. Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we continue to wait -- Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mount. Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him. A SLIGHT PAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it. Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and watches, but does not move to Solomon. Solomon waits, and waits -- WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats. He returns with two accomplices; COOK and RAMSAY. They carry with them large whips and a coil of rope. Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with Cross your hands. (beat) You resist, I swear I will break your head and cut your black throat. Cross your hands! 81. Solomon does as ordered. He's tied by Cook and Ramsay - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of it intensely palpable. Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone. Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight. Cook and Ramsay almost relish this; an opportunity to inflict hurt on Solomon. A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon. He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him. With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative. Gentlemen -- Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man. Tibeats, you are a scoundrel, and I know it. You richly deserved the flogging you have received. I have been overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of William Ford, am master here. My duty is to protect his interests. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him, he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life. As for you two, begone. If you have any regard for your own safety -- I say, begone! Cook and Ramsay don't need to be told twice. The pistols Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without further word, they mount their horses and ride away. 82. Tibeats remains, and his anger with him. Yah got no cause. Platt is mine, and mine ta do with as I please. Yah touch my property, I will 'ave yah strung up as well. Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree Run to the field. Fetch Lawson, hurry him here and bring the brown mule with him. Rachel runs off. A FEW MOMENTS, then LAWSON comes running You must ride to Master Ford. Tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay. Tell him they are trying to murder Platt. Hurry, boy. Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so! Lawson mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed.

The OTHER SLAVES work in the field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard. It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this time and space. Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute, he offers no further aid. 83.

As he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS HANDSOME, AND WELL It is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage. Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he started? From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon. He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation. 84. I believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere, too cowardly to show himself for a proper confrontation. He will in time. Tibeats wants you dead, and he will attempt to have you so. It's no longer safe for you here. Master Ford, I am willing to work. I will proceed with all my labors and more, but I beg that you take me from this hateful place. I cannot protect you. Master, please -- And I don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks. To strike him again is to warrant your death from all corners. It is best for you to go. I have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps. He will take charge of you. He is a hard man. Prides himself on being a "nigger breaker." But truthfully I could find no others who would have you.

Scene Action: EDWIN EPPS is a large, portly, heavy-bodied man with light hair, high cheekbones and a Roman nose of extraordinary dimensions. He has blue eyes, a fair complexion and is full six feet high. His manners are repulsive and coarse, and his language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education. 85. He reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old -- though in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant sexuality. MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone of compassion with which Ford read. "And that servant which knew his Lord's will -- WHICH KNEW HIS LORD'S WILL and prepared not himself -- PREPARED NOT HIMSELF, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes" D'ye hear that? "Stripes." That nigger that don't take care, that don't obey his lord - that's his master - d'ye see? - that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes. Now, "many" signifies a great many. Forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes -- That's Scripter!

Forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes -- That's Scripter!

SCENE 121:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - FIELD - DAY134134
Scene Action: It is August, "cotton picking" season. We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow. 86. There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are again filled. Solomon, as with the other slaves, is picking cotton. It is hard, harsh back breaking work. Clearly he's not "skilled" at the chore - he moves along slowly and does not pick with any particular dexterity. Patsey, on the other hand, is the "queen of the field." She moves through the rows at speed, expertly picking the cotton. THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS "TYMBALS" IN THE HEAT and a Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by Treach. C'mon. Drive dem niggers. Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them without regard. Pick dat cotton. Move along now, hear?

This fact is not lost on the Mistress Epps. A few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear. Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square in the face. 90. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop. The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress. Sell her! C'mon, now. Wha's this? You will sell the negress! You're talkin' foolish. Sell little Pats? She pick with more vigor than any other nigger! Choose another ta go. No other. Sell her! I will not! You will remove that black bitch from this property, 'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville. Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me. Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear. That's a wager you will lose. Calm yerself. And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got. Or, go. 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her! Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she storms away. For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing. That damned woman! I won't have my mood spoiled. I will not. Dance! 91. Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon responds by playing. Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing.

MASTER SHAW, A WHITE PLANTATION OWNER, IS ON THE LAWN Sitting on the plantation's Piazza, Patsey is having tea with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER. It makes for a bit of a surreal scene. Platt Epps, good Sunday morning. Good morning, Master Shaw. I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey. May I approach? You may. Solomon makes his way over to the piazza. Excuse me, Mistress Shaw. Nigger Platt. 94. My apologies. Patsey, Master wishes you to return. Sabbath day. I's free ta roam. Massa know where I be. Understood. But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted. Drink tea, Nigger Platt? Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare. Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return? Anger be his constant condition. Sit, Nigger Platt. Sit and drink the tea that offered. Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has tea poured for him. What'n was Epps's concern? I'd rather not say -- L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine. All things in moderation. Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as diplomatic as possible. As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance. There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic. You know he has ill feelings toward your husband. He do. 95. Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is... That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man. A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt. No doubt -- if not born outta truth itself. The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back. I'm certain, with regard to Patsey's well being, Master Epps concern is only to mind what is his. Nothin' Epps desire come outta concern. It all outta jealously. I meant no disrespect. He ain't heard you. I meant no disrespect to you, Mistress. Ha! You worry for me? Got no cause to worry for my senses. Nigger Epps, I ain't felt the end of a lash in 'mo years than I cain recall. Ain't worked a field, neither. Where one time I served, now I got others servin' me. The cost to my current existence be Massa Shaw broadcasting his affections. 'N me enjoining his pantomime of fidelity. If that what keep me from the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be. A small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure. 96. I knowed what it like to be the object of Massa's predilections and peculiarities. And I knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence. A lusty visit in the night, or a visitation from the whip. And wit my experience, if'n I can give comfort, then comfort I give. And you take comfort, Patsey; the Good Lord will manage Epps. In His own time the Good Lord will manage dem all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day comin' that will burn as an oven. May be sooner, or it may be later, but it comin' as sure as the Lord is just. When His will be done...the curse on the Pharos is a poor example of all that wait 'fo the plantation class. As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip of her tea.

Scene Action: Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's. Waiting on the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for Patsey to go to him. Aware of his lewd intentions, knowing what's waiting for her, Patsey begins to lightly cry. Platt -- De old hog-jaw beckon. Do not look in his direction. Continue on as though he's gone unobserved by you. Epps does not care to be ignored. He lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage. Patsey! Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of the Found her, Master, and brought her back just as instructed. 97. What'd you tell her? What'd you say to Pats? No words were spoken. None of consequence. Lie! Damned liar! Saw you talkin' with 'er jus now. Tell me! I cannot speak of what did not occur. Epps grabs Solomon. I'll cut your black throat. Solomon pulls away from Epps, ripping his shirt in the process. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around the cotton field, easily keeping his distance. Epps, however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all. And quickly he tires. He's forced to bend over and suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach. Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath -- And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon. Again, Epps vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave. Platt -- Platt, liquor filled me. I admit that it did, and I done over reacted. It's the Lord's day. Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this. Help me ta my feet, and let us both pray forgiveness. Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down. And again 98. Platt -- Platt, I'm all done in. I have met my limitations, and I ain't equal to 'em. I concede to yah, but in the name of valor, help yer master to his feet. Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is attacked by Epps this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the blade and chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY At the house appears Mistress Epps.

But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry begin to falter before it. And eventually collapse right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note, none move to help him. None dare. Get him water. Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry, DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY ANYTHING Roused, Henry rights himself. Go'won. Git up. 100. Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and heads back into the field. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going.

Scene Action: WE MAKE A HARD CUT TO THE FIELD. Lit by moonlight, the cotton sets off an otherworldly glow. Into this space Epps is dragging Patsey. Far out into the field, he stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter. Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness. Epps's frustration mounts until as the Mistress Shaw had cautioned he crosses the line from passion to violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her. When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten, Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left him. Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries. She sets them down on a table. A moment from the dancing. Come sample what I baked for y'all. The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you, Mistress." 102. There'll be none for you, Patsey. Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness, however, Yah see that? Did yah see the look of insolence she give me? Seen nothin' but her turn away. It was hot, hateful scorn. It filled that black face. Yah tell 12 Years a Slave 05.18.11 93. MISTRESS me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin' I lie. Whatever it was, it passed. Is that how you are with the niggers? Let every ill thought fester in 'em. Look at 'em. They foul with it; foul with their hate. You let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night. Yah want that? Yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep? Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating. It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue. You are manless. A damned eunuch if ever there was. And if yah won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em. Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose. She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE SLAVE'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES. 103. FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN, the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face. Beat it from 'em! Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His intentions are plain. All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however, Eat. Fill yourselves. And then we dance. They eat, but without a hint of levity.

She then moves over to Platt. Platt -- Platt, you awake? I am. I have a request; an act of kindness. Patsey displays what she took from hiding. It is a LADY'S I secreted it from the Mistress. Return it! It yours, Platt. 104. For what cause? body to the margin of the swamp-- Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane. No. Take me by the throat. Hold me low in the water until I's still 'n without life. Bury me in a lonely place of dyin'. No! I will do no such thing. The -- the gory detail with which you speak-- I thought on it long and hard. How does such despair even come to you? How can you not see it? I got no comfort in this life; caught up between Massa's lust 'n Mistress's hate. If I cain't buy mercy from yah, I'll beg it. There are others. Beg them. Why do you consign me to eternal damnation with such an un-Godly request? There is God here! God is merciful, and He forgive merciful acts. Won't be no hell for you, Platt. But you leave me damned with every breath I draw. Born into this station, twenty-two year I suffer. My body so rent it 'mo scars than flesh. End my misery, Platt. Do what I ain't got the strength ta do myself. End it. 105. Solomon says nothing. Clearly he's not about to do the deed. One day I will look upon yah, 'n you'll know yah shoulda freed me when there was the chance. BLACK160160

Clearly the pair are being split up, AS WE HAVE SEEN FAR TO OFTEN WITH BLACK FAMILIES TO THIS POINT. This time, the Male Slave will not remain idle as his relation is taken from him. He tries to claw past the OVERSEERS screaming for her. The Overseers beat the man down, beat him back to wagon. Despite this, the man continues to yell after the woman as the wagon pulls away.

Scene Action: Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together. As he tries to rest, sleep is nearly impossible, Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA - the woman who we caught for a moment previously. She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact with Solomon. If not in regard for what personal space he has, then for a certain trepidation she seems to have and desire to carry alone. She seem, like Solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes. Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face. Fear, proximity -- They drive her hand to Solomon's. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE. Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act, really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT, FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN AN ANIMAL THAT The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more perfunctory than passionate. We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release. But more or substantially less than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret. And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all.

As little as he knows of her, as awkward as it was, the pair shared a moment and it is a moment not easily discarded. Solomon is almost unconsciously propelled toward Anna. Before Solomon can close the distance, the DRIVER chides the horse team and the wagon departs. Anna again looks back to Solomon, her eyes quietly pleading for him to do -- something. But there is nothing for him to do. Nothing he can do. The wagon rolls on -- and then it and Anna are gone.

Scene Name: EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - EVENING169169
Scene Action: Segregated slightly from other salves, Solomon sits before a small fire. A thought comes to Solomon. Crossing to some fencing, he tears loose a bit of wire. With the wire Solomon fashions a loop. Holding the wire to the flame of the fire, Solomon heats it until it glows, takes a moment -- THEN PRESSES THE LOOP TO THE FLESH OF HIS LEFT INNER-FOREARM. He winces greatly, and his eyes well not merely from the pain of the burns, but from other complexities as well. Solomon repeats the process again and again, renting his flesh in near self-mutilation as though doing penance and circling the burns until the marks resemble the STAIN GLASS FLOWER ELIZABETH HAD MADE FOR HIM. Here, at nearly his lowest point, Solomon literally burns the memory of his family onto himself.

Off the porch. Get off. Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down. Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to Solomon. Sir -- 110. Platt is it? Have you cultivated cane previously? No, sir, I have not. You take to it quite naturally. I surprise myself. I was poor for cotton picking, and suffered the lash on a schedule. For whatever reason the Lord has chosen to give me skills in the cane he has withheld otherwise. From where do you hail? Washington, sir. And upon bill of sale, here you came directly? Sir. You play the fiddle? I do. Where did you learn? Over time. Here and there. Are you educated? Niggers are hired to work, not to read and write. 111. Epps warned that I should mind you above all. However, I cannot help but take note of you. You don't carry yourself like the other niggers, and I sense that you have seen more of the world than you admit. I am just what is before you, sir. Nothing more. If anything Turner is impressed by Solomon's ability to dodge. What is before me is far too clever to be relegated to the field. You are to be elevated to a driver in the sugar house. We'll see if you take to the whip as well as the cane. You'll board with the other trustees. Sir. And Platt, now and again I hear of patrons in need of a good fiddler. I will pass along your name. What you earn is yours to keep.

"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely. Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As I am hungry. Give me food. Who are you? I'm hungry. All I have are some scraps of bacon. Solomon gives her some of his food. Celeste, famished, devours it. What is your name? My name is Celeste. What are your circumstances? 115. I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes.

A world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun. It twilight always in Celeste's world, even in the brightest day. I will live there, and I will live freely. The overseers are a cowardly lot. Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night. Others will join me, in the twilight and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever. Celeste will come to you again in the night. You will have food for her.

No. Solomon will never again see New York. Celeste's words is harsh, I know, but dey true. I entreat yah to come live wit me in the constant twilight. I entreat yah for your body to not die no slave.

There is one among the group who is of MIXED RACE, black and Native American. Though his skin is fairer as would be a Native American, HIS HAIR HAS THE KINK OF AN AFRO. Do you recognize them, Platt? Are these the pair who accosted you? Solomon stares, but does not dare answer. Runaways from a plantation in the vicinity of Lamourie. Hidden away for three weeks. The Bayou is full with them. Look carefully. Are they those who meant to take your life? I don't know their intent. 120. What else could it be? Beyond their hunger and desperation, their heads are filled to the point of lunacy with mythic idyll of life in the north. Nothing good will ever come of a nigger in flight. I cannot say what plans they held for me. But these are the two, then? I am uncertain. You may have your satisfaction with them. You deserve as much and they deserve no better. Master, I am uncertain. Look. Look careful. In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon. Solomon does, but does not reply. Even to you the features of your own kind are indistinguishable. The eyes. Subdued, and their eyes still burn. Is their hate familiar to you? Is it the hate that came at you in the night? Have your way with them, Platt. Solomon does not move for his whip. He says as convincingly as possible. They are not the ones. Turner may not quite believe Solomon, but he does not speak 121. Return them to Lamourie, but strip them bare and parade them in the streets. Make a show of it. A reminder to all the price of flight is of no bad consequence. Back to work, Platt.

When all were asleep in the cabin, by the light of the coals, lying upon my plank couch I managed to complete a somewhat lengthy epistle. The letter is directed to an old acquaintance at Sandy Hill stating my condition and urging him to take measures to restore me to liberty. 122. Yah has your freedom then? All that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office. As he does, Epps makes his way over. When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy. I have resolved to return to my Massa. Solomon gives an unnerved look. This is not good news. Is it more food you need? I live in fear. None will come after you in the swamps. It ain't the patrollers I scared of -- At all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps. At first their calls were welcomin'. Dey too was free, 'n I thought dey greeted me like a sistah. Lately, dey cries have turned horrifyin'. The solitude plays tricks. It's your impression, nothing more. Several times now they made me a midnight call, awakening me from what little sleep I take wit a terrifyin' growl. They mean to kill Celeste. If you go back to your master you face the same. 123. My freedom been nothin' but a daydream. So was Celeste's thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in the bayou. It is lonely dwellin' waiting for others who won't never come. Better the loneliness. You have been free most of the summer. Return now and your master will make example of you. Celeste, go north. Make your way by night -- It'll only be worse if'n Celeste don't go back of her own will. You won't be caught. The dogs won't track you. You are -- you are unique. Please, Celeste -- She does not say a word. She just looks at him -- and then her eyes close again. You got alternatives, Solomon. Celeste got no one to write a letter to. As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more Celeste departs toward the swamp. Celeste -- Celeste! She continues on and disappears into the night. Solomon will never see her again. BLACK190190

Complete Content: Solomon sits with Celeste. He relates his news to her. I have my letter. I succeeded in making ink by boiling white maple bark. When all were asleep in the cabin, by the light of the coals, lying upon my plank couch I managed to complete a somewhat lengthy epistle. The letter is directed to an old acquaintance at Sandy Hill stating my condition and urging him to take measures to restore me to liberty. 122. Yah has your freedom then?

Scene Action: We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits as Solomon AGED SEVERAL YEARS NOW Wiley and Bob trudge their way toward Epps and his other slaves who are gathered. The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned. 124. A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark times is behind us. Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague. As thick 'n white as New England snow. 'N now my niggers is returned to me. (to Solomon) Heard Judge Turner made you a driver. A driver? Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways? Well, yah won't stand idle with a lash in hand. Not on my land. Much work to do. Days of old long since, eh? Joyous indeed. Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms display many new scars. It's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for Epps and the Mistress.

Scene Action: 126. We come in after the punishment has been dealt. Patsey tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments to It's a tragedy. How does such come to pass? Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand. I'm of a damn sight better station. And my desires never lacked for imagination, though I will admit they have at times been short on ingenuity. But only at times. I've worked as an overseer, you know. I did not, sir. Not "sir." Just Armsby. Not owed more than any other in the field. I worked plantations from Virginia, down into Alabama. I could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so. But to toil in the field? Never thought that would come to pass. Never. But times are desperate. Where once I had said "no" to Epps and his merger offerings, I returned cap in hand. Look at what I've become. How did you arrive at such a place, if I may ask? Ask. It's just conversation. From a pocket Armsby produces a flask. 127. I became a little too dependant on the whisky, a little too undependable on the job. Before you say I'm just a sorry drunkard, let employment as overseeing is, it's no easy chore on the spirit. I say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in, and day out without shredding at his own self. Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected -- Or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations. Well, I trampled. Armsby takes a drink. And with frequency. Where is your place of birth? Maryland. Have you traveled there? I cannot say that I have. Fine country. More seasonal than the bayou. A deal less humid. Stop a moment. Have you any other name than Platt? Why did you leave it? 128. To make my fortune, of course. I gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity that were the lore of needed being a patch of land and a few good growing seasons. Cotton, or tobacco. And then locating a proper bank to store your riches. But such profitable outcomes are reserved for the plantation masters. It's the lot of the rest of us to serve. So I settled to be an overseer, and failed as well at that. In the meantime my dreams gave way to reality. Now, I want nothing more than to earn a decent wage. And get myself home. Armsby takes another drink and leans back. Oh, to be a nigger. Not a concern in the world and every need taken care off. Consider yourself fortunate, Platt. It's the plight of the white to worry.

I understand I've got a larned nigger that writes letters and tries to get white fellows to mail 'em. Solomon, hardly missing a beat, plays this off. Don't know nothing about it, Master Epps. Don't know nothing about it, sir. 133. Yah wasn't over with Armsby night before last? No, master. Hav'nt yah asked that fella to mail a letter fer yah at Marksville? Without overplaying things, Solomon gets real slick. Why, Lord, master, I never spoke but three words to him in all my life. I don't know what you mean. Well, Armsby tol' me today the devil was among my niggers. That I had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away. When I axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville. What have yah got to say to that? All I have to say, master, is all that need be said. There is no truth in it. How could I write a letter without ink or paper? There is nobody I want to write to 'cause I hain't got no friends living as I know of. That Armsby is a lying drunken fellow, they say, and nobody believes him anyway. You know I always tell the truth, and that I never go off the plantation without your given word. Now, master, I can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough. Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer? Yes. 134. That's it. He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us. He just made that story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't. Epps shallow mind is so easily manipulated Solomon is able to work it as though he were performing origami. We can nearly see Epps's thoughts being folded. I'm damned, Platt, if I don't believe you tell the truth. He must take me for a soft, to think he can come it over me with them kind of yarns, musn't he? Maybe he think he can fool me. Maybe he thinks I don't know nothing -- Can't take care of my own niggers. Soft soap old Epps. Damn Armsby! Set the dogs on him, Platt. That filthy unloved bastard. He will not separate me from my niggers. I will drive him from my land before the sun comes over it. Ohh, were he not free and white, Platt. Were he not free and white. Solomon Northup is my name.

The hell you don't! You know where she is! She run off, ain't she? She's escaped, and you miserable black dogs stand like the deef and dumb. My best cotton picking nigger! My best. I'd give yah all up for her. Where she gone? Not a word spoken. Epps wades in and among the slaves and begins to whip at them recklessly. Speak! Speak! The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to say. They don't know where she is. Eventually Epps slows, then stops. He drops down in great sorrow. She run off -- Pats run off.

Scene Action: Run off. Run off, did you? Massa Epps-- 136. You miserable wench! Where you been? I been nowhere. Lies to your misdeeds! The Sabbath day, Massa. I took me a walk to commune wit da Lord. Bring the Lord into yer deceptions? Yah Godless... Shaw's. Comin' from Shaw's plantation weren't yah? No -- Yah didn't run, did yah? Yah took yerself ta pleasure Shaw. Yah gave baser passion to that unblushin' libertine! Master Epps-- Now yah speak? Now that yah want to add to 'er lies yah find yer tongue. Epps goes to strike Solomon, but Patsey pulls his arm back. Do not strike him. I went to Massa Shaw's plantation! Yah admit it. Freely. And you know why. Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress. 137. I got this from Mistress Shaw. Misstress Epps won't even grant me no soap ta clean with. Stink so much I make myself gag. Five hundred pounds 'a cotton day in, day out. More than any man here. And 'fo that I will be clean; that all I ax. Dis here what I went to Shaw's 'fo. You lie -- The Lord knows that's all. You lie! And you blind wit yer own covetousness. I don't lie, Massa. If you kill me, I'll stick ta that. Oh, I'll fetch you down. I'll learn you to go to Shaw's. Platt, run get four stakes and straps a leather. At first Solomon does not move. Epps level all his rage at Get them stakes! Solomon runs quickly to the tool shed. In short order he returns with the stakes and a hammer. Drive 'em into the ground. As Solomon does so, Epps gives an order to Wiley and Edward. Strip her. Strike her bare 'n lash her to the stakes. Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House. She gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction. Now tied face down to the stakes, Epps stands over Patsey with his whip. 138. Yah done this to yerself, Pats! The slaves are now employed working on an extension to the Great House. Overseeing the project is MR. AVERY. Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high -- but no matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow. He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on. Do it! Strike the life from her. Epps again hoists the whip. It trembles in his hand ahead of the act -- But he does not have it in him to deliver such a Beat her. Solomon doesn't move. Epps shoves the whip into his hand. Give her the whip. Give it all to her! I'd rather it you, Platt. Strike her, or yah'll get the same! Solomon takes a step back. He unfurls the whip -- He begins to whip Patsey. Lash after lash, Patsey squirms before it. Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too distraught to watch. But the Mistress -- She is not satisfied with Solomon's half- hearted effort. He pantomimes. There ain't barely a welt on her. That's what your niggers make of yah; a fool fer the takin'. 139. Yah will strike her. Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or every nigger in my sight will die! Solomon can't do it, even if it means his life. But from the Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I am dead. What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears. Patsey screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again. After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied. Until I say no more! I ain't said nothing! Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE THAN Finally, Solomon tosses down the whip he can and will do no more. Strike her! Strike her! Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air. Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, Solomon describes without exaggeration literally flayed. The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground. Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying. Thou devil! Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin. 140. No sin. No more 'n if it'd kicked a chair that wouldn't stand right, or a stove that was no good for holdin' fire. Things that give me consternation. A man does how he pleases with his property. At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure. You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further. By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere. Everywhere else. Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back into the house. Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin. The slaves themselves work under the direction of MR. BASS, a large man, between forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and light hair. He is cool and self-possessed, fond of argument, but always speaking with extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent.

Scene Name: EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - GREAT HOUSE - DAY214214
Scene Action: As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does little more than joke his way around the facts. Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear. 141. I tell you what it is, Epps. It's all wrong. All wrong, sir. There's no justice. It is official business righteousness in slavery. I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well understood. More particularly among my creditors. system. Humbug, sir. No credit, no debt. Credit leads a man into temptation. Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from evil. But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point? What right? I bought 'em. I paid for 'em. Of course you did. The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon -- it lies. You are daft. Yes, Epps, when the law says that it's a liar, and the truth is not in it. Is everything right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave? That ain't a supposable case. Hope you don't compare me to a nigger, Bass. In the sight of God, what is the difference, Epps, between a white man and a black one? 142. Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got. Yah'd call them fellers citizens, I s'pose? Look here, Epps. You can't laugh me down in that way. (pointed) Some men are witty, and some ain't so witty as they think they are. But let that pass. These niggers are human beings. If they don't know as much as their masters, whose fault is it? They are not allowed to know anything. You have books and papers, and can go where you please, and gather intelligence in a thousand ways. But your slaves have no privileges. You'd whip one of them if caught reading a book. They are held in bondage, generation after generation, deprived of mental improvement. Who can expect them to posses much knowledge if they are not brought down to a level with the brute creation, you slaveholders will never be blamed for it. If they are baboons, or stand no higher in scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There's a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet. The "funny" has completely gone out of the conversation for You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of. Yah'd argue than black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you. A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England. But yah don't. You most assuredly do not. 143.

Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually as he Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you come from? What put that into your head? You would know if I should tell you. I was born in Canada. Now guess where that is. Oh, I know where Canada is. I have been there myself. Have you? Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places. And I have been in York state, too. Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal. Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare. Well traveled for a slave. How came you here? Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here. How's this? Tell me all about it. 144. I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should. Every word you speak is a profound secret. Solomon holds a moment. Hasn't he heard the same promise

Your story is -- it is amazing, and in no good way. Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said? I do. That slavery is an evil that should befall none? I believe so. If you truly do, I would ask. I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release. 145. Bass is somewhat overwhelmed by what Solomon has just told him. It takes him a moment to reconcile its magnitude. You understand the danger of such an act in case of detection. Your story, true or not; what we attempt is punishable in the strictest way. I understand. And you understand as well the necessity of strict silence and secrecy. Yes. I need to take note; names and addresses of those you think can aide you. Not here, not now. Can you sneak away in the night?

William Perry, Cephas Parker and Judge Marvin, all of Saratoga Springs, Saratoga county, New York. I had been employed by the later in the United States Hotel, and had transacted business with the former a considerable extent, and trust that at least one of them would be still living at that place. It is so many years since you left Saratoga. All these men may be dead, or may have removed. You say you obtained papers at the Custom House in New York. Probably there is a record of them there. And I think it would be well to write and ascertain. I will take the letters to Marksville and post them from there. After that, I must travel. I will return to Marksville in ten week's time. I will enquire then about responses before returning here. They sit on the banks quietly for a time as they absorb the enormity of their undertaking. Finally, from Solomon, a hint of hopeful emotion creeps forth though it is dispensed in a very matter-of-fact fashion. It would be unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and family again.

You are certain? 147. Write again. No use. There is every use. My freedom. No use. I have made up my mind to that. I fear the Marksville post master will mistrust something, I have inquired so often at his office. Too uncertain. Too dangerous. I have talked too openly of freedom for niggers. I have concern for my own life now. My beliefs have struck up against my fears. I will be honest that my fears preside. Solomon just then begins to realize the finality of the situation.

At the moment the conversation is regarding a book which Waddill holds - Uncle Tom's Cabin. 148. It's liberal fantasy, of course. Some call it literature. To my way of thinking it's sedition. Incredible that we have come this far. Or sunk this low; there is a true and genuine market for such twaddle. Dangerous days, sir. Dangerous. Far too much politickin'. The Soft Shells, the Hard Shells, the Hunkers and Barn Burners and Woolly Heads and Silver Grays. And the worst of the lot; the Free Soilers and the Abolitionists. They take root like a malignant plant. The north is lost to us. No offense. Northup gives a noncommittal nod. It is the territories we must hang on to, now. And by any measure. The Free Soilers, the Abolitionists; you are liberated of such kind yourself? Delightfully. Never -- but one here in Marksville. An eccentric creature who preaches abolitionism as vehemently as any fanatic in the North I would imagine. He is otherwise a generous, inoffensive man. But always maintaining the wrong side of an argument. It affords us a deal of amusement. He is an excellent mechanic, and almost indispensable in the community. He is a carpenter. Name a Bass. He has become familiar with me. Waddill gives a look, but before he can respond, Northup Where may I find this Mr. Bass? 149.

Incredible that we have come this far. Or sunk this low; there is a true and genuine market for such twaddle. Dangerous days, sir. Dangerous. Far too much politickin'. The Soft Shells, the Hard Shells, the Hunkers and Barn Burners and Woolly Heads and Silver Grays. And the worst of the lot; the Free Soilers and the Abolitionists. They take root like a malignant plant. The north is lost to us. No offense. Northup gives a noncommittal nod. It is the territories we must hang on to, now. And by any measure. The Free Soilers, the Abolitionists; you are liberated of such kind yourself? Delightfully. Never -- but one here in Marksville. An eccentric creature who preaches abolitionism as vehemently as any fanatic in the North I would imagine. He is otherwise a generous, inoffensive man. But always maintaining the wrong side of an argument. It affords us a deal of amusement. He is an excellent mechanic, and almost indispensable in the community. He is a carpenter. Name a Bass. He has become familiar with me. Waddill gives a look, but before he can respond, Northup Where may I find this Mr. Bass? 149.

Scene Name: EXT. STREET - EVENING222222
Scene Action: Bass is exiting his residence. Northup, who has been waiting, calls to him. Mr. Bass? Bass looks. He does not recognize Northup and is cautious to say the least. Are we acquainted? to ask you if you were on Bayou Boeuf last August. Yes, sir. I was there in August. Did you write a letter for a colored man at that place to some gentlemen in Saratoga Springs? Excuse me, sir, if I say that is none of your business. Perhaps I'm rather hasty, Mr. Bass. I beg your pardon. But I have come from the state of New York to accomplish the purpose of the writer of a letter post marked at Marksville. I am in search of Solomon Northup. If you know him, I beg you to inform me frankly where he is, and I assure you the source of any information you may give me shall not be divulged if you desire it not to be. Bass considers his next words. I have done nothing to be ashamed of. I am the man who wrote the letter. If you have come to rescue Solomon Northup, I am glad to see you. 150.

Scene Name: EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - FIELD - DAY223223
Scene Action: The Slaves are working in the field. Solomon too focused on Northup and the SHERIFF. While the Sheriff makes his way to the field, Northup remains Platt? Where is the boy called Platt? Sir -- The Sheriff crosses to him. Your name is Platt, is it? Yes, master. Pointing off to the distance. Do you know that man? Solomon looks toward the carriage. He has to shield his eyes from the sun. Recognition is slow coming to him. But when it does, it hits him as a rush. Henry Northup? Solomon starts for Northup, but he is pulled back by the Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomon's true identity. As he does, Epps makes his way over. Stop a moment. Have you any other name than Platt? Solomon Northup is my name. Sheriff -- Have you a family? 151. What's all this? It is official business. My nigger, my business. Your business waits. (to Solomon) Tell me of your family. I have a wife and three children. What were their names? Elizabeth, Margaret and Alonzo. And your wife's name before her marriage? Anne Hampton. I am who I say. Solomon pushes past the sheriff. As Solomon moves toward Northup, his pace quickens with each step until his personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run. The two old friends make contact with each other, wrap each other in a long and emotional embrace. It if finally broken by Epps, who has moved over with the Sheriff. Nah -- You will unhand 'em. Platt is my nigger! He is Solomon Northup. You say -- He belongs to no man. You say! You come here, unfamiliar to me, and make claims. 152. Not claims. I have no doubts. To hell with that! My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em! As is your right. As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts. Your decision. You damned me since you darkened my eaves. Glad to be done with yah. (to Northup) Take 'em! If you know what's wise -- we'll leave. The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back by Platt -- We need to make haste. Disregarding Northup, Solomon crosses over to Patsey. For a moment they just stand across from each other. Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around Solomon and they A moment longer they hold each other. They separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and Northup alight, the Sheriff taking the reigns. The Sheriff chides the horses and they start up. As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining state, the other slaves around her. WE STAY WITH HIM as he travels further and further from the slaves who are diminished by distance. Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more. BLACK224224 153.

SCENE 206:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY225225
Scene Action: It is a scene reminiscent of the top of the show. The Northup family gathered. Anne, again, in her finest attire. We see, Margaret who is now twenty SHE CARRIES WITH HER A BUNDLE and Alonzo who is seventeen. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family waits patiently, dutifully -- but anxiously. THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. It is Mr. Northup. He looks from face to face, makes sure all are prepared for what's to come. Northup steps from the room. A moment later SOLOMON ENTERS. He is clean, well dressed, but he bears the scares of his time away. Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They are, after all after twelve years little more than familiar strangers. In an effort to minimize the shock of the moment, Solomon I apologize for my appearance. I have had a difficult time of things these past many years. Solomon looks among his family. Trying to recall them as much as they look to see familiarity within him. Elizabeth. Margaret. Alonzo. You do not recognize me, do you? How could you? When I was removed you were but seven; a little prattling girl playing with her toys. Now -- you've grown to womanhood. And who is this? He is my husband. Husband? It is very good to meet you, sir. Solomon almost breaks, but he keeps himself together. We have much acquainting to do. 154. Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father. And this is your grandson. Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon -- We would have no other name for him. No other. As much as Solomon was trying to keep his emotions in check, the sight of his grandson -- The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming. Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically -- But ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. To lift his body and his spirit. But even at that their "embrace" remains a bit chaste, slightly formal. But has she holds him, Anne's fingers BRUSH THE BURNS ON SOLOMON'S LEFT FOREARM. She pushes up Solomon's sleeve, she looks at the marks, the flower -- Anne know exactly what it means and why it is on his arm. In that instant Solomon can no longer maintain his cool facade. The moment so very overwhelming, Solomon seeks solace Forgive me. There is nothing to forgive. The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each other for life -- and one would think for all the rest of their lives. BLACK226226
