Scene Name: INT. SOLOMON BROTHERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - 1979 - DAY 22
Scene Action: Lewis and HIS TEAM are doing a presentation to a bunch of STATE PENSION FUND MANAGERS with an old fashioned OVER HEAD ...The mortgage backed security. Or the private label M.B.S. What is that? I hope you don’t say that when you look at your wife’s pussy! They all HOWL except the fund manager who looks shocked but then finally laughs to fit in. Here’s how it works. You’ve got your average person’s mortgage. Fixed rate, 30 years... We see A HOUSE on the over head projector. Boring, safe, small pay off... Right? But when you have thousands of them all bundled together... We see an illustration of many homes. The next illustration shows them all “bundled” together with a bow. Suddenly the yield goes up and the risk is still low cause it’s a mortgage and who the hell doesn’t pay their mortgage? Dickheads and junkies. And because the risk is hedged these bonds allow for people with not so perfect credit to get homes. So you’re making money and you’re doing a good thing. BOND TRADER #2 Lewie is a fucking genius. 3. Uhm, what exactly is the credit rating on this bond? All my pension fund cares about is triple A rated risk. Risk? What risk? The only risk is that you get paid back too soon! Plus each of these mortgages is guaranteed by the U.S. Government. This bond gentlemen, is AAA rated. This is exactly what the Michigan State pension fund has been looking for. I’ll buy 20 million... BOND TRADER #2 Come on live a little! Twenty five million. Let’s break out the paper work!

Scene Name: INT. INDOOR POOL - DAY66
Scene Action: We see from under the water ADULT MICHAEL BURRY swimming laps. His strokes are clean and strong. Michael Burry gets out of the pool. He towels off and walks immediately to the lockers. I’ve always been more comfortable alone. I believe it’s because of my glass eye. I lost the eye from a childhood illness. It separates me from people. Most social interactions are awkward. For me, for the person. Even when I try to compliment someone it comes out wrong... The compliment, not the eye. (quarter beat) That wasn’t a joke. I’m just being clear. The other night there was a party with some old college associates.

Scene Name: INT. MICHAEL BURRY’S FUND OFFICE - DAY99
Scene Action: Michael is seated behind his desk in a t-shirt and shorts. Did you know they’re going up? Highest fraud rates since the 1930’s. We reveal he is talking to a YOUNG EAGER ANALYST in his office at the center of SCION CAPITAL, Michael Burry’s fund. Michael’s office is at the front enclosed in glass. There are 20 ANALYSTS working at desks in the main room outside the glass. +38% No. I didn’t know that. I’m sorry if I’m going on and on. My wife says I need to share more. MARCH 2005 3 years 6 months until the crash That seems healthy. I like your hair. Did you cut it yourself? What? No. I uh, paid someone. Oh. Beat. So, do I get the job? I really think I could help your fund. What? Oh sure. Right. Yes...um David. (onward) 8. Great! I guess I’ll find a desk. Is there anything you want me to work on for starters? Yes... Another long beat. Michael thinks. This beat keeps going. Finally the Young Analyst starts to speak just as Michael does. Did you find it strange- You can let me know later- I’m sorry. Did you find it odd that when the tech bubble burst in 2001 the housing market in San Jose, the tech center of the world, went up? Huh. I guess. I mean, no. It’s housing. It’s always AAA rated, low risk. Yes.... That’s the idea... (he knows what he needs now) I need you to get me the top 20 selling mortgage bonds. So you want to know what the top 20 selling mortgage bonds are? No. I want to know what mortgages are in each one. Wait, aren’t those bonds made up of thousands and thousands of mortgages? Yes. 9. The Analyst waits for Burry to complete the thought but he doesn’t. Right away Dr. Burry. Finally he leaves. Burry sits down at his desk and PUTS EAR BUDS IN while Googling “SEC mortgage brokerage firm violations” He gets no hits. An Asian American ASSISTANT walks by Burry’s office window and LOOKS AT CAMERA. I was Michael’s actual assistant for years. I know what you’re thinking, a hedge fund manager with a glass eye who unwinds by listening to thrash metal, come on. But he really did do that.

Scene Name: INT. SCION CAPITAL - MICHAEL BURRY’S OFFICE - NEXT DAY1010
Scene Action: CU of a COMPUTER SCREEN showing THOUSANDS OF COMPLICATED LINES OF MORTGAGES from a MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITY. The lines are almost indecipherable but we see Michael Burry is reading them intently like it’s a page turning mystery novel. (his internal thought process) 30 days late... Rate adjusts in one year... Foreclosed... Paid on time... rate adjusts in one year... Investment grade mortgage bonds full of high risk interest only adjustable rate mortgages... Do people really understand how an adjustable rate mortgage works?... Most of these are no money down loans... 105 LTV... 540 Fico score?... Why are the mortgage companies giving these people mortgages...? Outside Burry’s office we see the Analyst he just hired David at his desk talking to another ANALYST #2 10. What’s he doing? He hasn’t moved all day. ANALYST #2 He does this every few days. He hasn’t spoken to me since he hired me. 90 days late... 30 days late... These bonds are one of the banks’ biggest revenue sources... They need more mortgages to fill them... That’s why it’s all adjustable rate high risk... They’re giving mortgages to people who can’t afford mortgages in order to fill these bonds, in order to earn fees... As he continues to read we TIME LAPSE and see the employees start to leave at the end of day. Eventually THE MAIN ANALYST’S OFFICE IS EMPTY and THE SUN IS COMING UP OUTSIDE. These mortgage bonds might fail... No one thinks they can fail, but all that subprime credit risk is real, no matter how they slice and dice it... 30 days late, rate will adjust next year... 60 days late... These bonds will fail...

Scene Action: LAWRENCE FIELDS’S office is the opposite of Michael’s. It’s lavish with Manhattan views as is he. Haha! Really? But the housing market is rock solid. Greenspan just said bubbles are regional, defaults are rare. FIELDS motions to his assistant through the open door. Tell them I’ll be there in a minute... Greenspan’s wrong. I don’t think you mean to do it but sometimes you sound very dismissive and superior Michael. Alan Greenspan is the greatest Fed Chairman in history. It’s a fact. Greenspan’s wrong. He’s too focused on being right to realize he’s wrong. I don’t know how else you want me to say it. Burry spits out his coffee gargle into the garbage. Look, Metro Capital backed you four years ago when you were a doctor with a dinky web page and some inheritance money. And we’ve all done very well. Why don’t you just stick with stocks? I look for value whereever it can backed securities are filled with extremely risky subprime adjustable rate loans. 12. Once the majority of adjustable rates kick in 07’ they will begin to fail and when they fail above 15% the whole bond is worthless. The scene freezes. Mortgage backed securities, subprime loans, tranches... Pretty confusing right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it’s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better, for you to leave them the fuck alone. So here’s Scarlett Johansson under a water falls to explain...

Scene Name: EXT. SMALL WATERFALL - DAY1313
Scene Action: SCARLETT JOHANSSON in a white T shirt and cut off jeans let’s the waterfall run over her while explaining mortgage backed securities. Basically Lewis Ranieri’s Mortgage bonds were amazingly profitable for the big banks. They made billions and billions off of their 2% fee on each of these bonds they sold. But then they started running out of mortgages to put in them. After all, there’s only so many homes and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them. So the banks starting doing something different. Instead of creating mortgage bonds that were guaranteed by the US government, they started creating their own private mortgage bonds. No government, no pesky standards like good credit or minimum income. And then the big banks were able to fill the bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages and keep the profit machine churning. By the way, the risky mortgages are called “subprime.” Anytime you hear subprime, think shit. 13. Michael Burry found out these mortgage bonds that we supposedly 65% AAA were actually mostly full of shit, so now he’s going to “short” the bonds, which means to “bet against.” Got it? Good.

Aren’t they filled with hundreds of pages of mortgages? I read them. You read them? No one reads them. Only the lawyers who put them together read them. I don’t think they even know what they made. The whole housing market is propped up on these bad loans. It’s a time bomb. And I want to short it. Through what instrument Michael? There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds. The bonds are too stable. No one would buy them. I’m going to get a bank to make me one. Then I’m going to buy a ton of them.

Scene Name: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - GOLDMAN SACHS - DAY1616
Scene Action: A SALES REP (LUCY THALIA), an INDIAN NUMBERS GUY (DEEB WINSTON) all from Goldman Sachs sit across from Michael Burry. Michael looks very Men’s Warehouse in a blue blazer and slacks compared to the Goldman group who looks very GQ in Prada suits. I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds. A credit default swap that pays off if the underlying bond fails. You want to bet against the housing market? Yes. Why? These bonds only fail if millions of Americans don’t pay their mortgages. That’s never happened in history. If you’ll excuse me Dr. Burry, it seems like a foolish investment. Based on prevailing sentiment of the market, the big banks and popular culture, yes, it’s a foolish investment. But everyone’s wrong. There’s a beat and then everyone laughs except Michael Burry who wasn’t kidding. 15. This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry. If you offer us free money, we are going to take it. My one concern is that when the bonds fail I want to be certain of payment in case of solvency issues with your bank. They are shocked. I’m sorry. Are you for real? You want to be against the housing market the most reliable sector of the American economy and you’re worried we won’t pay you? Yes. That’s correct. The Goldman people whisper amongst themselves for a beat. We could work out a pay as we go structure that would pay out if the bond’s value falls. But it would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up. You’d have to pay us monthly premiums. Is that acceptable Dr. Burry? Mike starts pulling thick DOCUMENTS out of his backpack. He slides them across the table. Yes it is. Here are prospectuses on 6 mortgage-backed securities I want to short. They scan them. They're diligent, they make us wait. These should be fine. We are prepared to sell you five million in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds. 16. Can we do 100 million?

A credit default swap that pays off if the underlying bond fails. You want to bet against the housing market? Yes. Why? These bonds only fail if millions of Americans don’t pay their mortgages. That’s never happened in history. If you’ll excuse me Dr. Burry, it seems like a foolish investment. Based on prevailing sentiment of the market, the big banks and popular culture, yes, it’s a foolish investment. But everyone’s wrong. There’s a beat and then everyone laughs except Michael Burry who wasn’t kidding. 15. This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry. If you offer us free money, we are going to take it. My one concern is that when the bonds fail I want to be certain of payment in case of solvency issues with your bank. They are shocked. I’m sorry. Are you for real? You want to be against the housing market the most reliable sector of the American economy and you’re worried we won’t pay you? Yes. That’s correct. The Goldman people whisper amongst themselves for a beat. We could work out a pay as we go structure that would pay out if the bond’s value falls. But it would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up. You’d have to pay us monthly premiums. Is that acceptable Dr. Burry? Mike starts pulling thick DOCUMENTS out of his backpack. He slides them across the table. Yes it is. Here are prospectuses on 6 mortgage-backed securities I want to short. They scan them. They're diligent, they make us wait. These should be fine. We are prepared to sell you five million in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds. 16. Can we do 100 million?

You can read our agreement- Don’t throw our inception agreement in my face Michael. There was an underlying understanding that you wouldn’t act like a goddamn crazy man! 19. This isn’t crazy. It’s all very logical. So now we pay out premiums on these swaps against the housing market until the mortgages fail? In other words we lose millions until something that’s never happened before happens? That’s correct. And you have no doubts. You’re not nervous at all? I have no doubts. But yes, I’m nervous. It’s a very large position for me to take. And will you please tell me what the difference between doubt and nervousness is? Half beat. That is a very good question. And I’m sorry but I’ll have to get back to you on that. Have a nice vacation Lawrence. He hangs up. His computer and phone are dinging. 1. “Have you lost your mind? I’m seriously worried about you.” 2. “What the hell is a credit default swap???” 3. “I am not comfortable trying to guess what the peak of a 70 year housing spike is!” 4. “So you’re telling me that rather than receiving profits on stocks I will now be paying premiums on these credit default swaps you bought? How is this in anyway good news?” 20. “A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEW YORK ARE TALKING ABOUT WITHDRAWING THEIR MONEY FROM YOUR FUND.”

He wanted to short housing bonds? Who bets against housing? (due diligence) What’s the ABX at? 29. What’s the ABX? It tracks sub-prime mortgage bond value. Danny checks his computer. It’s down... Wow. That’s weird. It’s down three points since last year. I haven’t heard a peep about that. What was this guy’s name again? Jared Vennett. From Deutsche. He sounded pretty sketchy. One of the ASSISTANTS (the real DANNY MOSES) LOOKS UP TO This actually happened. I’m the real Danny Moses. A wrong number led us to one of the biggest leads in investment history. I still work in New York and I wasn’t that much of an optimist. Call him back. Tell him we want to hear his presentation.. You wanna take advice from a trader we don't know -- about a market we don't understand -- cause the idiot dialed a wrong number? Yeah. Why not? If he'd even show up, it'd be to screw us. Probably. 30. Definitely.

It was this guy from Deutsche who was talking about shorting housing bonds. In the middle of the call I realize he’s got the wrong FrontPoint. He wanted the one of the eighth floor. He wanted to short housing bonds? Who bets against housing? (due diligence) What’s the ABX at? 29. What’s the ABX? It tracks sub-prime mortgage bond value. Danny checks his computer. It’s down... Wow. That’s weird. It’s down three points since last year. I haven’t heard a peep about that. What was this guy’s name again? Jared Vennett. From Deutsche. He sounded pretty sketchy. One of the ASSISTANTS (the real DANNY MOSES) LOOKS UP TO This actually happened. I’m the real Danny Moses. A wrong number led us to one of the biggest leads in investment history. I still work in New York and I wasn’t that much of an optimist. Call him back. Tell him we want to hear his presentation.. You wanna take advice from a trader we don't know -- about a market we don't understand -- cause the idiot dialed a wrong number? Yeah. Why not? If he'd even show up, it'd be to screw us. Probably. 30. Definitely.

Mark, Porter, Vinny and Danny listen to the bond trader's spiel, which is condescending and very sharp. The Deutsche Rep hands out hard copies. So how many people have you talked to about this trade? A few. And there’s definitely some interest. SAYING “NO” “GET LOST JARED” “YOU’RE HIGH” ETC.

Scene Name: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS3939
Scene Action: (sarcasm) Which is why you’re here talking to us, a wrong number. Look, some people have called me in to just laugh at me on this deal. Is that what this is? That’s not what this is. That’s just Mark. We wanna hear this. Okay, here we go... On the table is a JENGA GAME of stacked wooden blocks. On the side of the blocks is written the ratings of the tiers AAA, AA, BBB, BB, and B. 31. This is a basic mortgage bond. The original ones were simple, thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together and sold with a guarantee from the US government. But the modern day ones are private and are made up of layers of tranches, with the AAA highest rated getting paid first and the lowest, B rated getting paid last and taking on defaults first. Obviously if you’re buying B levels you can get paid more. Hey, they’re risky, so sometimes they fail... He throws one of the B blocks into a TRASH CAN. But somewhere along the line these B and BB level tranches went from risky to dog shit. I’m talking rock bottom Fico scores, no income verification, adjustable rates... Dog shit. Default rates are already up from 1 to 4 percent. If they rise to 8 percent, and they will, a lot of these BBB's are going to zero. Jared chucks another B block and a BB in the garbage. And that, my friends, is an opportunity. You're sure of the math? Jared gestures to his CHINESE QUANT, sitting to his right. Jiang is my quant. Look at him, he doesn't even speak English. He won a national math competition in China. China. Yeah I’m sure of the math. Ted turns to camera. 32. Actually I do speak English. Jared likes to say I don’t because he thinks it makes me seem more authentic. And I finished second in the national math competition. Some people at work think Jared’s a dick but he’s great at his job. So you’re offering us the chance to short that pile of blocks? How? With something called a credit default swap. It’s like insurance on the bond. And if it goes bust you can make a 10 to 1, even 20 to 1 return. And it’s already slowly going bust. But no one’s paying attention cause all the banks are busy getting paid obscene amounts of fees selling these bonds. Basically I'm standing in front of a burning house and offering you fire insurance on it. Danny's trying to get his head around Jared’s numbers. How can the underlying bonds in these pools be as bad as you say? They wouldn't be legal. No one knows what's in these bonds. I've seen some that are 65% AAA rated that are actually full of 95 percent subprime shit with Ficos below 550. Get the fuck out of here! And now get ready to really have your mind blown. I just discovered this treat... (to camera) We discovered it. But that’s fine. He’s on a roll. 33. ...when the market deems some bond too risky to buy, what do you think happens to it? We just warehouse them on our books?! No. They get repackaged, with a whole bunch of other shit that didn't sell, into a A what? Jared takes a bunch of the BBB, BB and B rated blocks and makes a precarious NEW tower. A collateralized debt obligation. A C-D-O. We put a bunch of unsold B, BB or BBB bonds together, when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing's considered diversified and the whores at the ratings agencies rate it 92, 93% AAA. No questions asked. Holy hell... Say that again. The Collateralized debt obligation. It’s important to understand because it’s what allowed a housing crisis to become a nation wide economic disaster. So here is world famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain.

I ordered my fish on Friday which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted. But some of the fresh fish doesn’t sell. I don’t know why, maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin. So what am I going to do, throw all this unsold old fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage and take the loss? Bourdain chops up the old fish and pushes it into the big pot of “SEAFOOD STEW.” No way. Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don’t sell I throw into a “sea food stew.” See, it’s not old fish. It’s a whole new thing! And no one knows they’re eating three day old halibut. That is a CDO.

The banks, the ratings agencies, the government... They wouldn’t let this happen. 35. They would and they did. My whole department is long this stuff. The pricks are calling me Chicken Little and Bubble boy. But when reality hits the idiots in my department won’t be laughing. He starts pulling blocks out of the CDO and MBS towers and throwing them in the garbage. Triple B’s? Zero. Double B's? Zero. B's? Zero. On this last one, the table shakes... both towers collapses. Then that happens. What's that? That is Aermcia’s housing market.

He's dumping his position. What if he's right? You want him to be right! Yes, I do. When a bank offers a loan, people take it. Why? Because they assume banks know more about money than they do. 36. Banks have spent decades training us to let them handle our money and credit. How else do they get away with credit cards that keep you in debt for years? Student loan rates that you never get free of? Financing, for many Americans, is just a fancy term for getting raped. Then this guy walks in my office... tells me those same banks got greedy... lost track of the market ...and I can now profit off their stupidity? Fuck yeah, I want him to be right. Things can't be as bad as he says out there. Let's find out. That's our job. Why don't you hate this guy? He's everything you taught us not to trust. I can't hate him. He's so transparent in his self interest I kind of respect him. Would I buy a car from him? No way. Is he right about the mortgage market? Let's find out. (the others moan) Look, it's two very simple questions. Is there a housing bubble? And if there is, how exposed are the banks? Mark’s team can't resist him when he's in adventure mode. Yeah, okay. Fine. Sure. Vinny pfiffs his concession. 37. And let’s move fast. If Vennett’s right, it’s only a matter of time before every loser with a few million bucks in a fund jumps on this.

We’re excited to get set up on your trading platform. Cool. Here, guys, have a seat a second. He gestures to the chairs they just stood from. Not good. Ted asked me to do some meeting prep but I couldn't find any marketing material on you. 39-40. 39. Oh. Sorry. We don't have any. We recently moved here from Colorado. Got it. Can we see your offering documents? (sheepish) Brownfield is all our own money. Well, can you tell us how much you manage? Sure. It's 30 million, but we started four years ago with 110 thousand. So, our returns have been pretty phenomenal. We want to get an ISDA agreement with JP Morgan so we can deal in long term options. That's cool. But you're under the capital requirements for an ISDA. Like, by how much? One billion four hundred seventy million. Jamie and Charlie flinch. Does it make us look bad that we didn’t know what the capital requirements were? It’s not great. Awkward beat. Have a good one guys. He walks away. 40. B of A and Bear didn’t return our calls and even Wachovia blew us off. 30 million means nothing to these banks. They keep calling us “high net worth individuals.” Here’s the prospectuses and brochures of all the other losers who didn’t get past the lobby. There are scattered brochures and folders with names like “The Nostradamus Fund” and “The Long Short Group.” Under one is Jared Vennett’s “Shorting the Housing Market.” Look... This guy’s saying the housing market is a massive bubble... Jamie LOOKS TO CAMERA We didn’t really find Jared Vennett’s housing bubble pitch in the lobby of a bank that rejected us. The truth is, a friend told Charlie about it. And I read about it in Grant’s Interest Rate Observer. But this is more fun. This guy says there are 10 to 1 returns on credit default swaps on mortgage backed securities. He says they whole housing market will collapse... Freeze. For Jamie and Charlie , the housing market doomsday prediction was music to their ears.

Maybe we can get some Cuban food. I hear it’s amazing in Miami. I’m serious Danny. Knock it off. How is wanting to eat chipper? 44.

Your big mortgage bet concerns us. We have no confidence in your ability to identify macroeconomic trends. You flew here to tell me that? Why? I mean, anyone can see there's a real estate bubble. Actually, no one can see a bubble... that's what makes it a bubble. That's dumb, Lawrence. There are always markers. Mortgage fraud. It's quintupled since 2000. Average take home pay is flat yet home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt not assets. So, Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Super Cuts and doesn’t wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson? Dr. Mike Burry. And, yes. He does. Are you being sarcastic with us, Michael? I don't know how to be sarcastic. I don't know how to be funny. I don't know how to work people. I know how to read numbers. Okay, let's talk numbers. Lawrence changes tack. How big's your short position? Right now? It's 1.3 billion. And the premiums? 49. We pay roughly 80 to 90 million every year. (they wince) I know it's high but I was the first one to do this trade. It will pay. Watch. I may have been early, but I'm not wrong. It's the same thing! Lawrence raises a finger to ask his partner for restraint. You're managing, what, a fund of 555 million? (Mike nods) In 6 years it'll all be gone. On one bet. Second quarter of 07’ the adjustable rates will kick in and defaults will sky rocket. Says you. How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do, say in the next two quarters? (then) If your investors panic. It's 302 million. My God, Michael. No one will pull out! It'd be suicide! Yeah, I'm down 17 percent for the year, but if they trust me- - No one trusts you. 50. I’ve written several emails to the investors letting them know second quarter of 07’ is when our position on housing shows returns. I've been very clear. He sounds like a crazy man defending himself to a tree. There will be redemptions. Well, that would be really stupid. (angry) If the fund's capital drops too much, the swaps contracts are voided. And the banks get to keep the collateral! What? They didn't know this, and it seals the deal. Give us our money back. The sticker's on a brand new...

The brokers just nod, glad to be part of the conversation. How many loans do you write each month? 53. It's about 60. Maroon nods. Me, too. Almost. What was it four years ago? Ten. Maybe 15. I was a bartender. How many are adjustable rate mortgages? Most. Ninety percent. The bonuses on those sky rocketed a few years ago. Adjustable is our bread and honey. These are people buying a primary residence? No, they're all cash-out refi's, or property to flip. A shitload of condos. A few primaries. Do mortgage applicants ever get turned down? They laugh. Dude, if they get rejected I suck at my job. Even if they have no money? Well, my firm offers NINJA loans. No Income. No Job. I just leave the income section blank if I want, corporate doesn't care. And the people just want a house. So they go with the flow. 54. We call those loans “Dorothys” cause they’re magic. No credit, no shoes together three times and say “There’s nothing like owning a home.” Your companies don't verify? If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, the big banks buy it by Monday lunch. Same here. Can you two hold on a second?

I end up taking any appointment they'll give me and then the whole morning gets shot to hell. She goes to her desk... where Mark and Vinny wait. Alrighty. So. FrontPoint Partners. How can Standard and Poors help you? We don't understand why the ratings agencies aren't downgrading subprime bonds, since the underlying loans are deteriorating. Well, delinquency rates have people worried, but they're actually within our models. Models that you share with the banks. Couldn’t they be gaming them? 71. I highly doubt it. These are very large banks that care a great deal about their reputations. They care a lot more about their bonuses. I'm sure the world's banks have more nuanced incentives than abject greed, Mr. Baum. You're wrong. Then they'll go bankrupt. The marketplace is ruthlessly efficient. Mark considers this old saw a moment. Your convinced the underlying mortgages in these bonds are solid loans? That's our opinion, yes. these mortgage bonds are so solid why are all the stocks for the mortgage brokerage companies down? These are companies issuing the loans that make up the bonds and they’re tanking. She's inscrutable behind her sunshades. But the fact she doesn't argue tells us he's shaken her confidence. We believe our ratings will prove accurate. Have you ever refused to rate any of these bonds upper tranches AAA? Can we see the paper work on those deals? 72. I’m not under any obligation to share that information with you. Just answer me Georgia. Can you name one time in the past year where you checked the tape and didn’t give the banks the triple AAA percentage they wanted? Half beat. If we deny them the rating they'll go to Moody's. A stunned beat. She's not supposed to say this. If we don't work with them, they'll go to our competitors. Holy shit. They’re selling ratings for fees. Silence. Mark didn't know it was that simple, that cynical. You can afford to make less. Make less. It’s not my decision. I have a boss. Really? That’s the angle you’re taking? So anyone who has a boss can’t be held responsible for doing shitty and illegal things? What are you, nine years old? She takes her glasses off. Her eyes are watery, dilated. And what, pray tell, are your incentives?! Why are you in my office?! Is it maybe in your interest to have the ratings change?! How many credit default swaps do you own?! 73. She's nailed him. (quietly) That doesn't make me wrong. No, it just makes you a hypocrite.

We know the CDOs are taking losses and yet the price is frozen or going up. Maybe they’re frozen because the banks have no idea how to value them? I bet they’re so toxic the banks are just guessing! (half beat) I think we should buy more swaps. What?! No way! No.

Finally the group is exhausted from yelling and they run out of gas. You guys done? 75. Yeah. I think so. (holding his side) Jesus. I think I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling. Mortgage defaults are way up. Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds. Tell me why we shouldn’t pull out of this trade right now? Listen, I told you when we did this deal the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks are clueless. So now their foot’s on fire and they think their steak is done and you’re surprised? This isn’t stupidity, this is fraud. Hey, if you can tell me the difference between stupid and illegal I’ll have my wife’s brother arrested. Danny laughs. Everyone glares at him. I’m sorry. That was funny. I just don’t think you guys realize how clueless the system is. 73. Yeah, there’s shady shit happening but trust me, it’s all fueled by stupidity. Face it, as cynical as you all are I think you still have a shred of respect left for the powers that be. Not me. Okay, except Vinny. 76.

And what's "midprime"? A loan that's between prime and subprime? Midprime's exactly the same as subprime. That doesn't make sense. And if a bond is “rich” it is...? Loaded with assets? Overpriced and you probably lose all your money. (how did he know this?) I can’t sleep on planes so I did my homework. Ben stops, turns to his proteges. 78. Let’s focus up. Now what's our goal here? To figure out if this is the deal of a lifetime, or if everybody knows something we don’t and we’re about to get royally screwed. Good. Now don’t lose sight of that when you’re with the guys from Bear tomorrow morning. I set you up with a face-to-face. Great! Where’s the meeting? Mark, Vinny, Danny and Porter enter and cross past the Brownfield Guys. Five years ago securitization was a loser convention. 100, maybe 200 people would show. 500 billion dollars a year later and you get this. A lot of smug looks in this place. It’s like someone hit a pinata filled with white people who suck at golf. Who are all these clowns? According to Vennett, this is who we’re betting against. Vennett approaches the group with his young ASSISTANT, who hands out room keys. Hello gentlemen. My assistant Chris has your room keys. I trust your travel was uneventful? So when do we get face time with these charming folks? 79. They’ll be plenty of face time. But remember, we’re here to gather info, not advertise our short position. We don’t want to spook anyone. Got it? Mark nods. The group still checking out the crowded lobby. Seriously. Mark, you’ve got a very loud mouth. Can you muzzle it for a few days? So you don’t want me warning people that the entire conference is put on to normalize the buying and selling of worthless shit? Yes. Don’t worry. We’ll be good little boys.

We were hoping we could get a little more insight on the CDO’s from you we’ve got swaps on. SO, what do you think’s gonna happen to CDO’s in seven years? BEAR REP #1 7 years? I just need this CDO machine to keep going for another 2 years. By then I’ll be rich enough to get a place in Aspen. Do you have any concerns about the performance of the underlying securitizations? It’s easy to see delinquencies and even default rates on the rise. BEAR REP #1 Don’t be a buzzkill, dude. We didn’t bring you guys out here to talk work, OK? Then why did you? BEAR REP #1 We need a client along so we can expense the ammo. Aims machine gun at a poster of thug, and fires. Woooo!! 81. (to Jamie) Holy shit. These are the guys on the other side of our trade. They only care about their fees and bonuses. And they’re morons. We need to buy more shorts. Jamie checks his cell. You hit the main floor and price some more swaps.

Would you say it’s a possibility or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%?! Well... I would say it’s a very strong probability. Mark raises his hand again.

Truth is since we had our budget cut we don’t investigate much. Really? Then why are you here? I thought- I’m not here for the SEC. I’m here on my own dime. (she leans in) I’m floating my resume to some big banks. How’s your brother by the way? He’s good.

You just don’t have the money or the reputation. So I’m a broke loser with a bad reputation but don’t take it personally? They’re assholes. Let it go. (to Jamie) Did your friend from the SEC give any perspective? The SEC isn’t even paying attention. Their budget has been gutted and they know zip about the housing market. It was actually depressing. People wanted small government, they got it. They eat for a beat, defeated. Wait a minute... We need a deal that we can afford and they can’t refuse, right? What if we bet against the AA rated tranches of the CDOs? What’s cheaper than AA? Come on Charlie. AA is so safe they barely even show up on the risk sheets for the banks. Are they really though? We know if the bottom tranches fail at over 8% the double AA tranches are worth zero. We also know the ratings agencies and the SEC are asleep at the wheel. I bet those AAs are more like Bs. 88. Jamie fishes some paper work out of his bag and points to some numbers. Charlie’s right. The pay off is 200 to 1. But they don’t see it so they’re charging pennies on the dollar to bet against the 83A. AAs. With that kind of risk/reward we’d be fools not to do it. Ben looks at the returns on AA swaps. Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns... No one on the planet is betting against AA. The banks’ll think we’re high or having a stroke... And they’ll take every dime we have. Charlie LOOKS TO CAMERA This is the thing we did that no one else did. Even Burry and Baum didn’t imagine the AAs could fail. MONTAGE OF CHARLIE, JAMIE AND BEN MEETING DIFFERENT BANKS OVER DRINKS, LUNCH, BLACKJACK TABLE, POOL SIDE. I don’t understand, you want to bet against AA? BEAR REP #1 Brother, I will sell you as much as you want. And you can shoot with us anytime you want. What’s the angle here? No angle. We want 10 million against a AA housing CDO. Yes. Of course yes.

But they don’t see it so they’re charging pennies on the dollar to bet against the 83A. AAs. With that kind of risk/reward we’d be fools not to do it. Ben looks at the returns on AA swaps. Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns... No one on the planet is betting against AA. The banks’ll think we’re high or having a stroke... And they’ll take every dime we have. Charlie LOOKS TO CAMERA This is the thing we did that no one else did. Even Burry and Baum didn’t imagine the AAs could fail. MONTAGE OF CHARLIE, JAMIE AND BEN MEETING DIFFERENT BANKS OVER DRINKS, LUNCH, BLACKJACK TABLE, POOL SIDE. I don’t understand, you want to bet against AA? BEAR REP #1 Brother, I will sell you as much as you want. And you can shoot with us anytime you want. What’s the angle here? No angle. We want 10 million against a AA housing CDO. Yes. Of course yes. Wow. I thought this trip might be a waste of time. Wow. 89. Yes. Yes and yes.

Scene Action: As they get AROUND A CORNER, Charlie AND Jamie SILENTLY CELEBRATE AND EVEN DANCE A BIT. But Ben tells them to cool it. Do you even know what you just did? Yeah, we made the deal of our careers. You just bet against the American economy. If we’re right it means people lose homes, jobs, retirement savings, pensions. These aren’t just numbers. For every point unemployment goes up, 40 thousand people die. Did you know that? No... Jamie and Charlie look like kids who have been caught teasing an old person. We were just excited... Just don’t fucking dance. Okay? He walks off. Exiting through double doors. Where are you going? Home! I’ll call you when things get bad. Alright Ben! Talk soon! (then to Jamie) Jesus. I didn’t know it could be that bad for the country. I guess this hasn’t really hit me yet. I just got scared. Are you scared? 90. I’m always scared.

Scene Name: INT. TABEMASU ASIAN RESTAURANT - HOTEL - NIGHT127127
Scene Action: LIONEL RITCHIE’S EASY. A tranquil waterfall out of plate glass windows. Jared walks in with Mark and his team. Alight Mark Baum from Frontpoint Partners... You’re nervous you and your swaps are being played? Now you get to meet who you’re betting against. Try not to get too righteous and listen for once. Okay, okay. So who is this guy? CHAU (50), Chinese-American, an expensive suit. I'm a CDO manager. At Harding Advisors. I didn't know there was anything to manage. We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio, and monitor the assets. I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs. Mark glances through hibachi steam to see Jared... raising his beer. Meet your counter-party. Meet the sucker. And you represent investors or the bank? The investors. But Merrill's only going to send you buyers if you put Merrill’s bonds in your CDOs. 91. Let’s just say Merrill and I have a good relationship. Mark can't tell if Mr. Chau is being naive or just arch. Are you worried about rising default rates? I assume no risk for these products myself. Let me get this straight. The bank calls you up. Gives you bonds they want to sell. Gives you the clients. Gives you the money to run your business. Gives you fat fees for doing so. But you represent the investors? Mr. Chau finally chuckles -- he’s actually being defiant. Yes. But my office is not in the Merrill Lynch building. We’re in New Jersey. 20 minutes away. 5 if we use a helicopter. huddle with Mr. Chau. Mark’s animated, speaking too loudly. Say that again! Say that again! Uh-oh. Your boss is about to explode. No. He’s too curious to explode. Ignoring his food, Mark scribbles furiously on a napkin. 92. CDO A has parts of CDO B and CDO B has parts CDO A, but then both get put inside CDO C? 88-89. That one's called a CDO Squared. And then there are CDOs made up of the opposite side of the bet you made with your swaps. We call them synthetic CDOs. “Synthetic CDOs?” as decorous as ever, enjoying his dessert. Another paper napkin slaps the counter. Okay. This is a pool of, say, 50 million in subprime loans. How much money could be out there betting on it through these synthetic CDOs and swaps?! Right now?! Tonight?! A billion dollars. What?! Mr. Chau shrugs. How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds than actual mortgages?! Twenty times? We FREEZE on his disoriented expression. 93. If the flawed mortgage bonds that Michael Burry discovered were the match. And the CDOs Jamie and Charlie bet against were the kerosene soaked rags... Then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb with a drunk President holding his finger over the button. At that moment Mark Baum realized the whole world economy might collapse. But I’m sure you’re wondering one “synthetic CDO?” Well here is Dr. Richard Thaler, the father of Behavioral Economics and international pop star Selena Gomez to explain.

Scene Name: INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT128128
Scene Action: SELENA GOMEZ sits at a black jack table with a giant stack of chips. She wins another hand and rakes in more chips from the PROFESSIONAL DEALER. A crowd cheers her on around the table. She can’t lose! That’s seven hands in a row! So here’s how a synthetic CDO works. Let’s say I make a bet of 10 million on a black jack hand... 10 million because this hand represents a simple mortgage bond. She is dealt a Jack and an 8 by the dealer. Selena is showing 18 and the dealer is showing a seven. So the odds are very much in Selena’s favor. 87% to be exact. Which are like the great odds most perceived the housing market to have. Did you really create a whole field of economic study? 94. Well is was inspired by the great work of others, but yes. I have 30 million twitter followers. I have 30,000. (Trying to be encouraging) That’s not bad. (back to the explanation) So my odds are great. And I am on a winning streak. Everyone else here wants in on this. I can’t lose, right? We have done countless studies that show that people often make this error in their thinking. If something is happening-- like Selena winning seven hands in a row Or the housing market going up for seven years straight... Exactly. They think it will go on forever. It’s called extrapolation bias. People see something happening and they extrapolate that it will continue to happen. So the people who are watching and think I can’t lose will make a side bet which is the first CDO. We see A WOMAN IN GLASSES standing behind SELENA. She turns * to a BUSINESS MAN. Wow. I love Selena Gomez. And she’s won seven in a row with a seven showing for the dealer. I bet you 50 million she wins and I’ll give you three to one odds. 95. 3 to 1 odds? Okay, I’ll take that bet. Then someone behind him decides to bet on their bet with someone else. That’s synthetic CDO number two. There’s a GUY IN A WARRIORS GAME JERSEY talking to a AN OLD Hey I bet you 200 million that lady in the glasses wins that bet. She probably will win, she always does, so I want a great pay off. How about 20 to 1? Deal. And this goes on and on and on and on.... With more and more CDOs betting on the bet on the bet on the bet... This happens all the time. In the stock market. In sports. In basketball, they call the Hot Hand fallacy. A player hits 3 shots in a row and everyone thinks he is definitely going to make that 4th one. We know, from a lot of statistical evidence, that there is no such thing as hot hands, but people refuse to accept that. People are cray cray. I don’t know what that means. We see a LONG LINE OF PAIRS OF PEOPLE making bets of increasing value and complexity that stretches behind Selena and Dr. Thaler at the table down the hall and around the corner and out of the doors of the casino. 96. And then the dealer plays out his hand. The dealer turns over a 3, giving him 10 and then turns over a King. DEALER WINS. No! How could I lose!? There is then a long chain reaction of winners and losers’ reactions. Shit! Pay up! Crap! Wait, I lost? I want my money! How could Selena lose! Nooo!!! They all should have known the odds they could lose. But they got overconfident. And because of the synthetic CDOs and all the bets on bets on bets... The one loss becomes thousands of losses. And those losers? Pension funds, insurance companies. City governments all over the world. Crazy shit right? Not crazy, just human. The crazy part is assuming people will act logically all the time.

And I’m a banker. I’m a part of this horrible world. A silence between them. Cynthia refuses to break it. 93A. And I keep thinking about my brother. About Paul. And how he... When he...

"As you may know, our agreement allows me to take extraordinary measures when markets aren't functioning properly. I currently have reason to believe the mortgage bond market is fraudulent. So in order to protect investors from this fraudulent market I've decided to restrict investors’ withdrawals until further notice. Sincerely. Dr. Michael Burry." Mike breathes deep, and hits SEND. He sits listening to the quiet hum of office outside his open door. The distant highway. A very long beat. Slowly at first, isolated, then gathering like an angry storm, the office PHONES begin to RING and his email box begins to ding. “Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.” - Haruki Murakami, 1Q84 We DISSOLVE to TV Channels flipping from one to the next. 1) SOME SORT OF FLUFFY POP ENTERTAINMENT, a sitcom, game show, reality show. 2) BARRY BONDS defends himself in a press conference. 3) Footage celebrating Lance Armstrong.

They won’t devalue them until they unload them. This is the biggest fraud in banking history. It took years to build my relationships on Wall Street! 101A. No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this just because two guys in a garage-band hedge-fund thinks it’s the apocalypse. Don’t be a dick Casey. We didn’t say “apocalypse.” Wow. Wow. (tries again) 108. Look, these banks bought most of the government. They bought the ratings agencies. There’s no one left but you. This story is why journalism exists. If someone like you blows this off because they’re worried about access to the banks this country is fucked. Nice speech Kev. You sound like Oliver Stone. (he gets up) Look, I’ve got work to do.

If you need any files from 2005- Mr. Field’s suit is very specific to files from the past year. Well then tell Lawrence I said hi. 110. Burry’s PHONE rings. The caller ID is Thalia/Private. (answering) You can't get back to me for a whole week? I'm so sorry, Mike. Goldman had a systems failure. I lost a ton of messages. B of A said they had a power outage. And Morgan Stanley said their server crashed. Huh. That's weird. I would call it improbable. Where do you have our position marked? It could be the same, Mike. Can you explain that to me? How's the value of an insurance contract in no way affected by the demise of the thing it insures? They’re independent markets. They’re not always correlated. I know it sounds odd but these are very complicated products. They are correlated, and I can prove it. How? You'd never claim they're uncorrelated on a hard line -- those are recorded bank records -- but you'll say it on your cell phone. Static. 111. Hello? Mike, I need to call you right back. She clicks off. Mike hangs up. The phone RINGS again almost immediately. Goldman. (answers) I'm listening. Dr. Burry? Yeah. Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs. Listen, I've been reviewing your position. I wanted to discuss your marks, make sure they're fair. Mike realizes what's happened. I think you mean you've secured a net short position yourselves so you're free to mark my swaps accurately for once. Because it's now in your interest to do so. Static. I'm not sure what you want me to say. Nothing. Mike hangs up. There. See. Done.

Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark. I’m sure you’ve been hearing rumblings about some losses Morgan has suffered. He nods. She sits. Congratulations. What? He points to the breast pump. Oh. Thanks. I just wanted you to know that yes, Morgan has suffered some losses but our liquidity is strong and there’s no cause for concern. What about Bennie Leibman? Is he concerned. Word on the street is he took some heavy losses. Half beat. 114. We know each other too well Kathy. How bad is it? Okay. Two years ago, Bennie Leibman in Morgan’s bond department also started shorting subprime housing. 2 billion in triple B’s. Bennie's smarter than I thought. Not smart enough. The premiums on the swaps ate into his desk's profit. To cover his triple B shorts he sold a lot of A and double A swaps as protection. A lot. He believed there was no way they could be affected. Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn’t hold those contracts. Silence. They held them. What’s your exposure. 3 billion? Don’t tell me it’s over 4. I can’t answer that. And I’m not sure there’s even a definitive answer. Kathy, you bring me in here to say everything’s fine and you don’t mention Bennie’s losses. You’ll have to pardon me if I don’t believe a word you’re saying right now. Beat. Our long exposure is somewhere between 12 and 16 billion. 115. Jesus Christ... Are you fucking kidding me? He kept saying defaults over 8 percent were impossible. There'd be a million homeless. And how is that a reason it can’t happen?! No one thought... Please don’t do this Mark. Like it or not you’re part of Morgan. Kathy, given Morgan's leverage, what are you doing to prevent a run on this bank? We see she’s not just stunned, she’s terrified.

Or... we sell our swaps, when the market opens. We get our bonuses and our investors get their profits. We'd get 30 cents on the dollar. Not bad. They're worth three times that. If Morgan goes under it won’t matter. Forget it. I'm not giving away lifeboats. Mark, don’t play a game of chicken on this one. Drop it! Christ, Vin. We sell when I say we sell. Don't pussy out on me! I get that this is what you’ve dreamed about but we have a fiduciary responsibility to- No. No we don’t. No one is being responsible. So fuck responsibility.

Scene Name: INT. AUDITORIUM - DEUTSCHE BANK HQ - DAY158158
Scene Action: Dark. Elegant. A well-heeled crowd of 200 INVESTORS. March 14, 2008 121. As the housing markets and banks continued to hemorrhage only one of Mark Baum. So it was beyond perfect when he was asked to speak at a conference opposite Bruce Miller, a famous bullish investor. After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan, one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak. Everyone in Mark’s office showed up and even invited friends.... This was Ali versus Foreman of the financial world... The realist versus the fools. If it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened. And it was beautiful. A podium waits for Greenspan. Beside it are 3 chairs with THE HOST, BRUCE MILLER, ruddy and confident and a sloppily- dressed Mark Baum. Vinny's in the front row. As some of you may know, Bear Stearns just received a loan from JP Morgan. We'll see how the market reacts, but I think that lays to rest concerns about the bank's health. I take it you have no plans to sell your 200 million in Bear stock? When we're done here, I'll probably buy more. For the opposing view, Mr. Baum. I gotta stand for this. Wholly uninvited, Mark takes his mic to the podium. 122. Okay, hi, so my firm's thesis is idea, Lewis Ranieri’s Mortgage Bond and turned it into an atomic bomb of fraud and stupidity that is on it’s way to decimating the world economy. How do you really feel? The crowd laughs. I’m glad you still have a sense of humor. I wouldn’t if I were you. (back to the crowd) Now, anyone who knows me knows I have no problem telling someone they’re wrong. Hell, it’s my passion. (beat) Well for the first time in my life, it’s not so enjoyable. Arriving late, Porter slips in the last row behind Danny. (whispers) Bear Stearns issued a press release denying rumors of liquidity problems. (whispers) They said they had liquidity?! That always means they don’t. We’re living in an era of fraud in America. Not just in banking. But in government, education, food, religion, journalism, prisons, baseball... Somehow, American values became fuck it, let’s grab what we can for now and the hell with tomorrow. Danny gets a quote, curses, types, Here we go! Bear at 47! 123. And what bothers me isn’t that fraud is “not nice” or “mean.” It’s that for fifteen thousand years fraud and short sighted thinking has never, ever worked. Not once. How the hell did we all forget that? Vinny gets a text...Bear at 35 last! I thought we were all better than this... I really did. And the fact that we’re not doesn’t make me feel superior and right... It makes me feel sad... In the back, a man hurries out holding on his cell phone. And as fun as it is seeing pompous dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, (turns to the Bull) and you are wrong sir. (back to his wrap up) I just know that at the end of the day regular people are going to pay for all of this. Because they always, always do. Danny's just typed Bear at 29 last!!! as he hears this. That's my two cents. Thank you. Mark pats Bruce Miller on the back as he takes his seat. Does our bull have a response? Only that in the history of Wall Street, no investment bank has ever failed except when caught in criminal activities. So I stand by my Bear Stearns optimism. A YOUNG BANKER stands, unwilling to wait for the Q & A. Mr. Miller! Sorry. Quick Question. 124. From the time you guys started talking, Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38 percent. Would you buy more now? (unsure) Sure. Yeah. I'd buy more. Why not? Awkward silence. Mark whispers into his mic... Boom. Mark watches the whole room scramble for the aisles.

They didn’t care. They knew the tax payers had to bail em out. Those fuckers. (and then) At least we’ll see some of them go to jail. And they’re going to have to break up the banks.

Complete Content: Mark as before, quiet, talking to Vinny via cell phone. slowly Mark!? At least tell me what you're thinking. Paulson and Bernanke just left the White House. There's going to be a bailout. Mark’s voice is full of masked emotion, quiet, resigned. 132. You're serious?! Yeah... The whole time we were wondering how the big banks could be so stupid... They didn’t care. They knew the tax payers had to bail em out. Those fuckers. (and then) At least we’ll see some of them go to jail. And they’re going to have to break up the banks.

SCENE 151:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT ROOF GARDEN - CONTINUOUS185185
Scene Action: Mark silently looks off into the distance, still on the phone with Vinny. Mark? (beat) Can we sell now? The fund’ll make almost a billion dollars... You’ll clear 200 mill Mark. You know once we sell we’re just like all the rest... No we’re not Mark... We didn’t prey on people’s dreams of owning a home... They did. And now we can kick em in the teeth. A billion dollars... That’s right. But we’ve got to sell or it could be zero. It’s now or never. It really is. Long beat. Okay... Sell it all. The Big Short 134. And then over black... “When the dust settled from the collapse 5 trillion dollars in pension money, real estate value, 401k, savings, and bonds had disappeared. 8 million people lost their jobs, six million lost their homes. And that was just in the USA.” “Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley attempted to sue the ratings agencies but were laughed out of all law offices. Jamie still runs Brownfield with Ben Rickert but Charlie left New York to live in Charlotte and start a family. He did not go on Lithium.” “Cynthia says Mark Baum actually became gracious after the collapse and never said “I told you so” to anyone. But he did give large sums of his money to a charity that helps people escape from cults. Danny, Vinny and Porter all still run a fund together and are as terrified as ever.” “Michael Burry contacted the government several times to see if anyone wanted to interview him to find out how he knew the system would collapse years before anyone else. No one ever returned his calls. But he was audited four times and questioned by the FBI. The small investing he still does is After a beat... “In 2015 several large banks began selling billions in something called a “bespoke tranche opportunity.” Which according to the Wall Street Journal is just another name for a CDO.”
