SCENE 1:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. DEEP SPACE11
Scene Action: A dark screen is lit up by twinkling stars. Baba? Yes, my son? Tell me a story. Which one? The story of home. A meteorite drifts into frame, heading towards tiny Earth off in the distance. Millions of years ago, a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it. The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals affected by vibranium. And when the time of man came, five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength, speed, and instincts. A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands from the sand animation, and we see them unite, and then break apart as conflict arises. Bashenga rises above the conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite the tribes. The warrior became King and the first Black Panther, the protector of Wakanda. 2. Four tribes agreed to live under the King's rule, but the Jabari tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain region. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology more advanced than any other nation, but as Wakanda thrived the world around it descended further into chaos. We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda's secretive border. To keep vibranium safe, the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight, keeping the truth of their power from the outside world. We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city, as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on another part of the world... And we still hide Baba? Yes. Why?

Hey look, if we get in and out quick won't be any worries. You in the van come in through from the west, come around the corner, land right here. Me and the twins pulling up right here, we leavin' this car behind, ok? We coming... Suddenly, N'Jobu hears something that we don't... a familiar sound. Hide the straps. James quickly moves into action, hiding the guns in the walls as N'Jobu peers out a window, then clears the maps from the table and unrolls a tapestry on the wall, hiding a bulletin board. James cocks a handgun. Is it the Feds? No. A KNOCK rattles the door. James walks over and looks out of a peep hole, then turns back with a confused expression. It's two Grace Jones looking chicks... they're holding spears... Open it. You serious? They won't knock again. James opens the door and TWO DORA MILAJE (members of the All Female Wakandan Special Forces) slowly enter carrying LARGE SPEARS. They eye N'Jobu. DORA MILAJE 1 (SUBTITLE) (in Xhosa) Who are you? Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri. 4. DORA MILAJE 1 (in Xhosa) Prove to me you are one of us. N'Jobu grabs his bottom lip and flips it, revealing a vibranium threaded TATTOO glowing blue with Wakandan script. The Dora SWIFTLY SLAM their spears down in unison, making the sound of an EMP. All electronics in the room instantly DIE

Scene Name: INT. N'JOBU'S APARTMENT - NIGHT44
Scene Action: The room is pitch black, then... BOOM. The Dora hit the floor with their spears again and the lights come back ON, but now YOUNG T'CHAKA (dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Black Panther) stands before them. N'Jobu kneels at the sight of him. He swats James, urging him to do the same. (in Xhosa) My King... Young T'Chaka looks at James, who gapes in awe. Leave us. This is James. I trust him with my life. He stays, with your permission, King T'Chaka. Young T'Chaka looks at him for a long beat. As you wish. At ease... Young T'Chaka removes his mask, hands it off to the Dora and the women step out into the hall, closing the door behind them. (in Xhosa) Come baby brother. (in English) Let me see how you're holding up. N'Jobu stands. T'Chaka walks over to him and they embrace. 5. You look strong. Glory to Bast. I am in good health. How is home? Young T'Chaka's mood darkens. Not so good, baby brother. There has been an attack. Then, Young T'Chaka activates a simple looking beaded bracelet, KIMOYO BEADS, that project a hologram image of This man, Ulysses Klaue, stole a quarter ton of vibranium from us and triggered a bomb at the border to escape. Many lives were lost. He knew where we hid the vibranium, and how to strike. N'Jobu takes the news in. He had someone on the inside. Young T'Chaka waits for N'Jobu to come clean of the crime. He doesn't. Why are you here? Because I want you look me in the eyes and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda. I did no such thing. Young T'Chaka snaps a look to James. (in Xhosa) Tell him who you are. Zuri, Son of Badu. What? 6. N'Jobu's face goes ashen as James is revealed to be YOUNG ZURI, a Wakandan spy. Zuri reveals his vibranium lip tattoo. N'Jobu grabs him. James, James you lied to me? I invite you into my home and you were Wakandan this whole time? You betrayed Wakanda! How could you lie to me like - Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here? Zuri walks to the wall and removes a duffle bag containing VIBRANIUM CANISTERS, glowing blue. He shows one to Young T'Chaka. Prince N'Jobu, you will return home at once, where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes.

Eesh, you ruined my mission! My father is dead, Nakia. The news devastates her. I will be crowned King tomorrow, and I wish for you to be there. Nakia looks at T'Challa deeply. Then turns, catching eyes with one of the NIGERIAN CAPTIVES as Okoye brings them from around the truck. Carry yourselves home now, and take the boy. Get him to his people. The Nigerian Woman nods. Thank you. You will speak nothing of this day. T'Challa looks at the Young Militant for a beat before he, Nakia and Okoye disappear through the trees. The Nigerian Women and the Young Militant look up at the sky as the RTF takes off.

Scene Action: RAMONDA (50s, Queen Mother of Wakanda), and SHURI (18, Princess of Wakanda) stand on the pad flanked by AYO. Okoye, Nakia and T'Challa exit the RTF and Nakia bows her head. Queen Mother... Princess. My comfort for your loss. Thank you, Nakia. It is so good to have you back with us. Nakia nods. (to Ayo) Take her to the River Province to prepare her for the ceremony. Yes, general. Ayo nods and walks off with Nakia while Shuri watches closely. Did he freeze? Like an antelope in headlights. Shuri laughs at this. Are you finished? Okoye slams her spear into the ground, signaling the rest of the Dora to follow her off. T'Challa turns to Shuri. So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day. You wish. I'm here for the EMP beads, I've developed an update. 14. Update? No, it worked perfectly. How many times to I have to teach you, just because something works, doesn't mean that it cannot be improved. (teasing) You are teaching me, what do you know? Shuri holds out her hand and T'Challa drops the beads into her hand. Shuri heads off. I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off. Shuri! T'Challa smiles at this. Sorry mother. Ramonda turns to T'Challa. How are you feeling today, mama? Proud... your father and I would talk about this day all the time. He is with us, and it is your time to be King.

Scene Name: INT. WEST AFRICAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER2626
Scene Action: We see a black man in high-end street wear, around 30 years old. A RING hangs on a gold chain around his neck. This is 15. Killmonger stands dangerously close to the glass containing SEVERAL WEST AFRICAN ARTIFACTS. They range from what looks like iron gardening tools to masks and short range weapons. Flanking the room are TWO SECURITY GUARDS, slightly unnerved by his presence. We follow the MUSEUM DIRECTOR, a British woman (mid-40's) as she enters and walks up behind Killmonger as he studies the war masks. Good morning! How can I help you? I was just checking out these artifacts. They tell me you're the expert. You could say that. They're beautiful. Killmonger points at one of the masks. Where's this one from? From the Bobo Ashanti Tribe, present day Ghana. 19th Century. For real? What about this one? That one's from the Edo people of Benin. 16th Century. Now, tell me about this one. Killmonger points to a MINING TOOL off to the side. Also from Benin. 7th Century. Fula tribe I believe. Nah. 16. (amused) I beg your pardon? It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it's from Wakanda and it's made out of vibranium. Don't trip, I'mma take it off your hands for you. She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy. These items aren't for sale. How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it like they took everything else. Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. The Museum Director subtly looks back at the security guards, then makes a face and touches her stomach — indigestion. Killmonger smiles and leans over, whispering in her ear. You got all this security watching me ever since I walked in. But, you ain't checking for what you put in your body. The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a security guard walks up behind him. Alright, mate. Let's have it. Come on, mate. I think she might not be feelin' too good. The Museum Director suddenly slumps to the floor, clutching her stomach. Hey! Hey somebody get some help! Come here! Call a doctor, please! Hey please, somebody come help! 17. The security guards quickly rush to the museum director's aid. (into radio) Medical Emergency right away in the West African Exhibit please. Right away! Killmonger stands back and looks toward the door.

Come here! It's ok. You can go, but just don't tell anyone, alright? The SECURITY GUARD looks back at him unsure, then takes off. 18. Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back. Killmonger looks on at him confused. Bro, why you 'aint just shoot him right here? Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out...makes us look like amateurs. The LENS on a surveillance camera at the corner of the room looks on.

Scene Action: Klaue looks down at the slumped bodies of the guards. Turns to Killmonger. Now...let's see if you know what you're talking about... Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand. Klaue walks up to the PROTECTIVE GLASS surrounding a smaller case containing the mining tool and places his hand on it. An invisible charge SHATTERS the glass. That's just a taste. Klaue picks up the MINING HAMMER, studying it. The tool doesn't look like anything special. Klaue's hand SIZZLES BLUE and centuries of MUCK and GRUNGE drop off the hammer revealing that it's pure vibranium. Klaue smells it, and smiles. 19. Whoo... You're gonna be rich, boy. You better sell that quick. Oh it's already sold. Klaue waves Limbani over with the stretcher to load the hammer inside. He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLE off the tool, taking only the vibranium head. Whatever you try, the Wakandans'll probably show up. That'll make my day. I can kill two birds with one stone. Limbani approaches Killmonger who eyes a third MASK, expertly crafted and slightly haunting. He slides the mask inside the stretcher also. You're not telling me that's vibranium too, eh? Nah, I'm just feeling it. Killmonger lays atop the gurney and Limbani places an oxygen mask over his face.

Scene Action: In the water, ZURI (Now Wakanda's High Shaman), holding the massive SPEAR OF BASHENGA, addresses the arena. I, Zuri, Son of Badu, give to you, Prince T'Challa, the Black Panther! The Elders watch as Zuri holds up A CEREMONIAL VESSEL containing a mysterious concoction. The Prince will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away. Zuri pours the solution into T'Challa's mouth. T'Challa reacts violently, choking on the red fluid. T'Challa spasms, his veins expanding and his muscles contracting as the poison spreads through him. But soon, he stops shaking and exhales easy. Zuri turns to the audience. Damaku... Damaku... Victory in ritual combat comes by yield or death. If any tribe wishes to put forth a warrior, I now offer a path to the throne. The Merchant Tribe Warrior calls out. The Merchant Tribe will NOT challenge today. W'KABI, the head of the Border Tribe calls out. 22. The Border tribe will NOT challenge today. Nakia calls out, representing the River Tribe. The River Tribe will NOT challenge today. The Mining Tribe Warrior calls out. The Mining Tribe will NOT challenge today. Is there any member of royal blood who wishes to challenge for the throne? As she raises her hand, and a collective gasp is heard amongst the entire gathering. This corset is really uncomfortable. So could we all just wrap it up and go home? Ramonda pinches her, as the ELDERS groan, and the YOUNG WAKANDANS can be heard laughing. T'Challa smiles and shakes his head. The sound of WOODEN DRUMS and loud chanting suddenly interrupts. Everyone looks to the mouth of the main CAVE where SIX JABARI WARRIORS and TWO JABARI DRUMMERS file out. Adorned in elaborate wooden armor, the warriors hold large wooden spears that look like javelins. The Kingsguard coil tightly as stunning the CROWD, the Jabari's imposing leader, M'BAKU, emerges last. Where W'Kabi and Nakia unsheathe their weapons and Okoye readies the Dora Milaje. 23. Shuri turns to her mother. Are they Jabari? Yes. Zuri confronts M'Baku. M'Baku. What are you doing here?! It's challenge day. We have watched and listened from the mountains. We have watched with disgust, as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child who scoffs at tradition. M'Baku points his spear at Shuri, who's eyes grow large. AYO steps in front of her. And now... you want to hand the nation over to this prince... (he steps nose to nose with T'Challa) Who could not even keep his own father safe. Hmm? We will not have it. I said we will not have it! (beat) I, M'Baku, leader of the Jabari wish to — (interrupting) I accept your challenge, M'Baku. Glory to Hanuman. Zuri puts the Panther mask on T'Challa. M'Baku grins and places a WOODEN GORILLA MASK over his face. He clenches his fist and calls out for his Jabari soldiers to form a semicircle behind him, pointing their spears at his back. 24. T'Challa lifts his hand and calls out for the Dora, who fall into place behind him, making a perfect CIRCLE OF SPEARS surrounding the fighters. Zuri raises his hand, ill-at-ease. Let the challenge begin! The warriors CLASH, both with great skill. M'Baku with superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield. Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS BACK but instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and counter with TWO FIERCE KICKS. M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they respond LOUDER! M'Baku charges at T'Challa, knuckle-walking, and slipping his assault, T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it to land another KICK. The two continue to battle, BLOCKING and TRADING BLUNT STRIKES, until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears. With the deadly spears at his back, T'Challa blocks COLOSSAL OVERHEAD BLOWS with his shield, then M'Baku leans with all his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS. Clubbing M'Baku to his heels, T'Challa rushes forward for an aerial attack only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest, causing him to LOSE both his shield and spear! Where is your God, now?! Defenseless, T'Challa DODGES SPEAR-SWIPES before M'Baku corrals him into a BEAR HUG and delivers a CRUSHING HEADBUTT. M'Baku LAUGHS through his mask. No powers. No claws. No special suit, oh! Just a boy, not fit to lead.

T'Challa TIGHTENS HIS GRIP and M'Baku begins to fade. What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further. You have fought with honor, now yield! Your people need you. M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors. Yield, man! 26. M'Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Challa lets him go and is barely able to stand himself as Zuri steps forward. The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath, T'Challa proudly lifts his arm. I now present to you, King T'Challa the Black Panther!! Zuri. My King. Drums begin to play and people start to dance. T'Challa and Nakia stare into each other's eyes amidst the celebration as... Wakanda forever!! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically.

I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SON OF King T'CHAKA!! You can do this T'Challa! T'Challa wedges M'Baku's spear UNDER HIS FOOT and PULLS M'Baku to the pool, FLIPPING his body into a SERIES OF LEG M'Baku FIGHTS, but can't escape. Yield! Don't make me kill you. I would rather die! T'Challa TIGHTENS HIS GRIP and M'Baku begins to fade. What would the proud Jabari do without you? T'Challa tightens further. You have fought with honor, now yield! Your people need you. M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors. Yield, man! 26. M'Baku grudgingly reaches out and TAPS. T'Challa lets him go and is barely able to stand himself as Zuri steps forward. The crowd ERUPTS as struggling to catch his breath, T'Challa proudly lifts his arm. I now present to you, King T'Challa the Black Panther!! Zuri. My King. Drums begin to play and people start to dance. T'Challa and Nakia stare into each other's eyes amidst the celebration as... Wakanda forever!! The arena ECHOES THE PHRASE emphatically.

A massive ACACIA TREE stands in front of him. T'Challa sees several YELLOW EYES looking at him and realizes PANTHERS are resting on the branches of the tree. T'Challa approaches. A large panther jumps down, then stands on two feet to reveal it's T'CHAKA. T'Challa looks at his father and immediately pulls him into a hug. Baba! 28. (in Xhosa) My son. T'Challa kneels down before his father, overcome with grief. I am sorry. Stand up! You are a King. T'Challa rises, and they begin to walk. (in Xhosa) What is wrong my son? (in Xhosa) I am not ready, Baba. (in Xhosa) Have you not prepared to be King your whole life? Have you not trained and studied, been by my side? That is not what I am talking about. I am not ready to be without you. A man who has not prepared his children for his own death has failed as a father. (beat) Have I ever failed you? Never. (beat) Tell me how to best protect Wakanda. I want to be a great King, Baba. Just like you. You're going to struggle. So you need to surround yourself with people you trust. You're a good man with a good heart. And it's hard for a good man to be King. 29.

I came to support you, and to honor your father. But I can't stay. It's just...I found my calling out there. I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye. I can't be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing. T'Challa thinks on this. What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit. Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it... other countries do it, we do it better. 30. We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess — we could lose our way of life. Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time. Nakia gives T'Challa a look. If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen. I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn. Ah! So you admit it! ...if that's what I wanted!

T'Challa stands beside him. Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing? W'Kabi laughs. Of course. I see Nakia is back... you guys going to work it out? T'Challa shakes his head and crosses in front of W'Kabi. T'Challa, what's wrong? 31. Nakia thinks we should be doing more. More like what? Foreign aid... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head. You let refugees in, they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. T'Challa thinks on this. Now, if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world, then I'd be all for it. But waging war on other countries has never been our way. Then, both of their Kimoyo beads buzz. You too, huh? Bast, are we in trouble? Their beads combine to project a display of Okoye. My King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar.

A misidentified Wakandan artifact was stolen yesterday from a British museum. We have learned Ulysses Klaue plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer in South Korea tomorrow night. There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue. Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret. I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial. Wakanda does not need a warrior right now. We need a King. My parents were killed when he attacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us, from me. It's too great an opportunity to pass. Take me with you. We'll take him down together side by side, eh? I need you here protecting the border. Then I ask, you kill him where he stands, or you bring him back to us. You have my word I will bring him back. (beat) We will proceed with the mission.

(beat) Who are you taking with you to Korea? Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia. You sure it's a good idea to take your ex on a mission? Yes. We'll be fine. (beat) Besides, you will be on call, should we need backup. Shuri smiles at this and points out small communications devices. 34. I have great things to show you, brother. Here are your communication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with audio surveillance system. She walks him over to another table with WDG disks on them. Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table. Curious, T'Challa notices a pair of SLEEK SHOES. And what are these? The real question is what are those? Why do you have your toes out in my lab? Shuri points at T'Challa's traditional sandals. T'Challa smiles. What, you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day. (rolls her eyes) Yea I bet the elders loved that. Try them on. T'Challa puts his feet into the shoes, and they lace up instantly, forming a perfect fit. Fully automated, like the old American movie Baba used to watch. And I made them completely sound absorbent . T'Challa stomps his foot down without a sound. Interesting... Guess what I call them. 35. T'Challa thinks on this. Sneakers... T'Challa looks at her blankly. Because you... never mind. Shuri walks T'Challa over to two mannequins. One wears T'Challa's CURRENT SUIT. The other, just a panther tooth If you're going to take on Klaue you'll need the best the Design Group has to offer. Shuri points at T'Challa's current suit. Exhibit A. Old tech. Old...? Functional, but old. Eh, people are shooting at me... wait let me put on my helmet... T'Challa smiles, amused. Enough... (pointing to the necklace) Now look at these. T'Challa spots a GAUDIER GOLD TOOTH NECKLACE. She notices. Do you like that one? Tempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one. Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa. (pointing at the necklace) 36. Now tell it to go on. T'Challa does, and without warning, MILLIONS of vibranium laced NANITES spill from the necklace and form a new BLACK PANTHER SUIT around the mannequin. Oooh!! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. Strike it. Anywhere? Mhm. T'Challa turns to the mannequin in a relaxed fighting stance. Shuri nods and T'Challa SPIN KICKS the shit out of the mannequin! Not that hard, genius! You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard. Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot. I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around. Well maybe you should make it a little stronger, eh? Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit GLOWING INDIGO where the impact of T'Challa's foot landed. T'Challa looks closely at the glowing script. Wait a minute. The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribution. 37. Very nice. Now strike it again, in the same spot. T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her Kimoyo. T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously. You are recording? For research purposes... T'Challa loads up then BOOM! He kicks the indigo spot and goes flying back across the room, CRASHING INTO A TABLE full of Shuri's gadgets. Shuri cracks up. Delete that footage...

We see Nakia's POV as she makes out THREE CIA AGENTS on the first floor, spread out under the balcony. Five. How could you miss "Greased Lightning" there behind you. Standing over the balcony looking, Okoye spots TWO MORE CIA agents, both with greasy hair. 40. An elegant waitress carries a tray of drinks to a CRAPS TABLE where we find T'Challa. The woman places the drinks down as T'Challa peers across the gambling pit at someone he recognizes and starts that way. (into comm) Six. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got a little more complicated. T'Challa steps up to another crowded CRAPS TABLE next to EVERETT ROSS, the sixth CIA agent he spotted. Agent Ross. Your highness. Ross plays it cool. You are buying from Klaue... What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to, do me a favor and stay out of my way. I gave you Zemo. And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I'd say we were even. Ross places a Pass bet. T'Challa dumps a stack of chips on Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice. You really need to leave, now. They watch the dice roll. They land on 3. The dealer takes away Ross' bet, and slides T'Challa's massive payout over to him. 41. Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned. T'Challa walks toward another craps table, leaving the pile of chips behind (money means nothing to him). (to the empty chair) Hey, you won. Ross scratches his brow as a THIRSTY GAMBLER (Stan Lee) who was sitting next to T'Challa grabs them. Ross eyes the Thirsty Gambler who shrugs. You know what, I think I'll just take these, bring 'em over here and hold on for safe keeping. He slides them all onto the DON'T PASS bet and Ross walks off in search of T'Challa. (into comm) Ok heads up, the King of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue. T'Challa stands at a ROULETTE TABLE when Ross walks up to him. Alright, vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person that I'm not actually saying I'm here to make a deal with but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles you and I can work something out. I am not here to make a deal. Ross rolls his eyes.

Complete Content: Nakia slips into a seat at the bar and looks around clocking the room. (in Korean) Over here. One whiskey, please. Eyes up. Americans. I count...three. We see Nakia's POV as she makes out THREE CIA AGENTS on the first floor, spread out under the balcony. Five. How could you miss "Greased Lightning" there behind you. Standing over the balcony looking, Okoye spots TWO MORE CIA agents, both with greasy hair. 40. An elegant waitress carries a tray of drinks to a CRAPS TABLE where we find T'Challa. The woman places the drinks down as T'Challa peers across the gambling pit at someone he recognizes and starts that way. (into comm) Six. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got a little more complicated. T'Challa steps up to another crowded CRAPS TABLE next to EVERETT ROSS, the sixth CIA agent he spotted. Agent Ross. Your highness. Ross plays it cool. You are buying from Klaue... What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to, do me a favor and stay out of my way. I gave you Zemo. And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I'd say we were even. Ross places a Pass bet. T'Challa dumps a stack of chips on Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice. You really need to leave, now. They watch the dice roll. They land on 3. The dealer takes away Ross' bet, and slides T'Challa's massive payout over to him. 41. Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned.

Scene Name: INT. FIRST FLOOR - CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT6868
Scene Action: Ross keeps his cool as Klaue approaches. Well that is quite the entourage. You got a mixtape coming out? Klaue cuts Ross a look. Yeah! Yeah, actually there is one. Shocked, Ross is unsure if Klaue is serious. Yea I'll send you the soundcloud link if you like. Klaue turns to one of his goons. Aye, Dave. Get him the link to the tape. The SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGH reaches into his pocket for his phone. Please don't make me listen to your music. I just meant, you got a lot of people with you. Oh, you think they're for you? Klaue laughs at this. Don't worry. I can do a deal with you all by myself, thank you very much. 44. He rubs Ross on the shoulder, hard, and for way too long. As several more SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGHS come pouring out of the VIP lounges. Six more, it's a set up. You got the diamonds? Klaue is still rubbing Ross' shoulder. Ok, that's enough. A CIA AGENT walks a FANCY SLIM BRIEFCASE towards Ross. We need to move on Klaue. Stand down. We can't afford a shoot  out. Ross eyes Klaue as the CIA agent brings him the briefcase. The vibranium? Klaue looks around, and reaches into his pants and pulls out a wrinkled, sweaty paper bag, with "FRAGILE" written on it with a sharpie. Ross looks at the bag. I was going to buy a fancy suitcase, but I thought I'd save myself some money. It's now or never. Nakia continues towards the CIA agent. 45. (in Xhosa) STAND DOWN! A South African Tough hears her, and turns towards her. Hey. Okoye pretends she doesn't hear him. Hey! (into comms) (in Xhosa) I've been made. Okoye starts for the stairs when ANOTHER TOUGH moves to cut her off. Okoye slows down and the TOUGH trailing behind her reaches out to grab her hand and turn her around. As soon as the goon touches Okoye, she TWISTS him into an ARM  BAR, throws her purse at the OTHER TOUGH and extends her spear, stabbing the OTHER TOUGH in the foot. She then throws her WIG into the ARM BAR TOUGH'S face, and hurls him over the railing. The arm-bar tough CRASHES DOWN onto a gaming table behind Klaue and startled patrons, scramble in every direction. Klaue spins toward the commotion as... Klaue looks back to Ross and spots T'Challa. Producing a HANDGUN from his waist, Klaue opens fire on Ross and the CIA agent. Ross uses the SLIM SUITCASE as a shield as he ducks down below the craps table and... T'Challa leaps to action, KICKING and FLIPPING THE TABLE on its edge to block GUNFIRE from Klaue's other toughs. With bullets flying everywhere... PANICKED PEOPLE run for their lives. It's CHAOS. Surrounded by TOUGHS, Klaue retreats for the stairs. Get the diamonds, quick! 46. EVERY ONE OF KLAUE'S TOUGHS unload, raining shells on the overturned craps table with Ross and T'Challa behind it. The TOUGHS move in only to have T'Challa leap from the table, staying low to FOOTSWEEP one onto his back. T'Challa kicks him back then disarms another TOUGH and kicks him into the bar. T'Challa then spins and kicks the next TOUGH over the roulette table and through the bar railing. Nakia grabs a goon in an ARM TWIST trying to relieve him of his gun. She takes off one shoe and knocks out another approaching gun. Swings the arm twisted goon to the floor, knocks him out, taking his gun and shooting up towards the balcony where Okoye is fighting. Okoye BATTLES TWO TOUGHS with her full-length spear, dropping both with proficiency. She kicks the gun away from one, fights another with her spear, then kicks a TOUGH over the rail. Okoye JUMPS down to the casino floor and stabs a goon on her way down, tucks and rolls. Okoye takes out a TOUGH with her spear. Nakia flips a TOUGH over her back. T'Challa sends a TOUGH and table flying. Beats down two more TOUGHS, he turns for more. T'Challa spots Klaue nearing the entrance and breaking away from the fight, LEAPS HALF WAY UP onto a column, bounds off to the UPPER BALCONY

He took a bullet for me. That was his choice. 66. T'Challa stiffens. Okoye has gone a little too far. Torn, Nakia stares off, thinking about the Nigerian women they didn't bring back to Wakanda and her culpability in Ross' injury. So now we are just supposed to let him die?

T'Challa's eyes lower regretfully. He slipped through our hands. Slipped? For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing. With you I thought it would be different. But it's more of the same.

The paint truck pulls to a stop on the airstrip. Killmonger, Klaue, Limbani and Linda hop out, and hump their gear to a FOUR-SEATER ESCAPE PLANE parked on the airstrip. Let's get going, boss. You always sell to the CIA? I sell to the highest bidder. Don't you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I'll make sure both you guys get paid. Oh I ain't worried about the money, bro. I know you're good for it. Klaue smiles. On our way back, just drop us of in Wakanda. 68. You don't wanna go there, boy. Yea I do. Killmonger suddenly draws a HANDGUN and SHOOTS LIMBANI DEAD. Reacting to the shot, Klaue crowds Linda with a skilled GRAPPLING MOVE and snatches her gun away before she can fire on him. Killmonger finds Klaue holding Linda's gun to her head, using her as his shield. (stumped) Drop it, or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. Put your gun down now! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Erik. It's gonna be ok. Killmonger fires without hesitation. The BULLET TRAVELS THROUGH Linda, killing her while Klaue dives behind the plane, WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER from the round. Killmonger moves to finish Klaue but he's gone. Following Klaue's blood trail, Killmonger STALKS Klaue through the Klaue fires at Killmonger, missing.

I ain't worried about no brand. Check these out. Killmonger rolls up his sleeve, uncovering SEVERAL AFRICAN SCARIFICATION MARKS on his forearm. Each one is for a kill. You can scar yourself as much as you like. To them, you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there. Killmonger flips the inside of his bottom lip, revealing a glowing Wakandan TATTOO. Klaue can't believe his eyes. And to think I saw you as some crazy American. Klaue starts laughing, hard. Killmonger aims and pulls the trigger at point blank range.

Colon-who? My name is Everett. Yes, I know. Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA. Right. Groggy, Ross gazes around at the completely unique technology. Ok, is this Wakanda? (still working) No, it's Kansas. ...How long ago was Korea? Yesterday. I don't think so. Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight. They do here. But not by magic, by technology. (beat) Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon. 74. Leery, Shuri watches Ross wander about out of the corner of her eye. He walks over to the observation deck and gazes in awe at the exposed GLOWING ROCKS inside of the VIBRANIUM Suddenly an AUTOMATED MINING CART whips between light panels floating above a rail. These train things...that's magnetic levitation, right? Obviously. Obviously...but I've never seen it this efficient. The light panels, what are they? Sonic stabilizers. Sonic what? In it's raw form, vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed, so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it. (in disbelief) There's vibranium on those trains? There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you. Ross tries to process this as a 3D PROJECTION OF OKOYE unexpectedly forms. Where is T'Challa? His Kimoyo beads have been switched off. Ross, amazed, tries to touch the sand projection. Well we are not joined at the hip, Okoye. 75. A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue. What? W'Kabi is transporting him as we speak to the palace. We need to find your brother. An outsider? No, a Wakandan. An IMAGE OF KILLMONGER from the border appears on Shuri's monitor. Then...

I'm standing in your house. Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your King couldn't deliver. T'Challa walks close enough to Killmonger to be able to whisper to him. I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are...now what do you want? I want the throne. The entire room scoffs at this. Some ELDERS even hold their heads back and laugh. (in Xhosa) My goodness. Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good. There's about 2 billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder, Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all. And what tools are those? Vibranium. Your weapons. 78. Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own. Not your own? But didn't life start here, on this continent? So ain’t all people your people? I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to see how T'Challa will respond. Then, Ramonda suddenly speaks. Son, we have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request. Killmonger eyes the Elders with an amused grin. Oh, I ain't requesting nothing! Ask who I am? You are Eric Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are. (laughing) That's not my name, Princess. Ask me, King? No. Ask me. Take him away. 79. (in Xhosa) Who are you? (Xhosa) I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu. A hush falls over the room. The tribal elders knew N'Jobu. This changes EVERYTHING. (in Xhosa) The son of N'Jobu? I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest. You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer! (in Xhosa) You're lying! (in English) Lies. I'm afraid not Queen Mother. W'Kabi produces Killmonger's GOLD NECKLACE and RING. Holding it up for everyone to see. (in Xhosa) The descendant of N'Jobu. Hey Auntie. I'm exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of King and Black Panther. Utter silence as all eyes turn to T'Challa. T'Challa desperately wants to refuse but knows that isn't possible. Do not do this T'Challa. 80. As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights. He has no rights here. The challenge would take weeks to prepare. Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him... and somebody to get me out of these chains. T'Challa, what do you know of this? I accept your challenge. W'Kabi looks at T'Challa closely.

Killmonger is escorted in by W'Kabi. 77. W'Kabi tensely steps next to T'Challa as Killmonger takes his place before the circle. (in Xhosa) Speak. (translates for Killmonger) Speak. I'm standing in your house. Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your King couldn't deliver. T'Challa walks close enough to Killmonger to be able to whisper to him. I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are...now what do you want? I want the throne. The entire room scoffs at this. Some ELDERS even hold their heads back and laugh. (in Xhosa) My goodness. Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good. There's about 2 billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder, Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all. And what tools are those? Vibranium.

The King will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away. Staring T'Challa down, Killmonger suddenly turns to Zuri. They recognize each other. Zuri looks away ashamed. Nakia arrives through a tunnel and walks up to Okoye, who turns to her. Where is Agent Ross? I locked him in the office. He's not going anywhere. T'Challa holds his short spear and shield. He stares at his cousin. This is your last chance, throw down your weapons and we can handle this another way. Killmonger slams his blades into the stone. I lived my entire life waiting for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed, just to get here. He takes off his vest and tears at his shirt, revealing the SCARIFICATION MARKS that go up his arm and across his entire back. They number in the hundreds. I killed in America, Afghanistan, Iraq. I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on the continent. And all this death, just so I can kill you. T'Challa looks to Zuri and nods. (reluctant) Let the challenge begin. 82. Killmonger tears forward with expert knife work and T'Challa with skilled defense. T'Challa PARRIES several strikes, countering with a LEG TAKE DOWN but hesitates with his sword and doesn't strike as they roll toward the edge of the waterfall. Back on their feet, they circle, and Killmonger lunges at T'Challa who dodges. T'Challa manages to knock Killmonger off his feet, gaining the advantage. Yield! Killmonger FEROCIOUSLY BOBS INSIDE, but T'Challa lunges at Killmonger, giving him a superficial SLASH ACROSS his cheek. Fueled by rage, Killmonger begins to overpower T'Challa. He slices T'Challa's thigh. Snap out of it T'Challa! Wielding both blades, Killmonger slashes deep across T'Challa's stomach, then spins, CUTTING deep into his bicep. Hurt, T'Challa realizes his compassion was a mistake and he must fight back but blood leaks from his side. Killmonger dodges T'Challa's next attack. Stumbling, T'Challa is unable to avoid Killmonger's BLADE BEING THRUST into his ribs. The elders gasp as Ramonda looks away and Shuri just stares.

Nakia, I am not a spy who can come and go as they so choose. I am loyal to the throne, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to? I loved him. I love my country too. Then you serve your country. No. I save my country. Nakia takes off.

Killmonger strolls in, wearing the new gold panther necklace. You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place. Killmonger stands and walks looking each of them in the eye. I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them. We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side. It's time they know the truth about us. We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top. Killmonger sits. 92. The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire. Okoye looks to W'Kabi.

Complete Content: Every Elder, the Border Tribe military leaders, including W'Kabi, the Kingsguard leaders, Okoye, and the Dora prepare for a council meeting. Killmonger strolls in, wearing the new gold panther necklace. You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place. Killmonger stands and walks looking each of them in the eye. I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them. We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side. It's time they know the truth about us. We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top. Killmonger sits. 92. The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire. Okoye looks to W'Kabi. Wakanda has survived for so long by fighting when only absolutely necessary. Wakanda has survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General. Elders, it is getting smaller.

That's what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries. They would always strike at transitions of power...like an election year or the death of a monarch. You get control of government, the military — Our resources. The Great Mound. Our vibranium. All of my designs. He will send our weapons all over the world. T'Challa turns to Nakia. (motioning to Shuri and Ramonda) 98. You must get them out of Wakanda safely. What? What about you?

The Border Tribe soldiers look on at T'Challa and grow visibly nervous. Border Tribe! Ay! Ay! Phambili! W'Kabi pulls his sword and triggers the SONIC FIELD around it. He points it towards T'Challa and the Border Tribesmen line up in a battle formation and charge towards T'Challa. A Dragonflyer takes off overhead and leads the charge downhill. Okoye turns to Killmonger. You! Your heart is so full of hatred you are not fit to be a King. She slams her spear and the Dora fall in line behind her as Killmonger stares her down. Killmonger pulls his blades, and activates his PANTHER SUIT from his necklace as Talon Fighters take off in the background. Ayo. The King. Some of the Dora take off down the hill to fight for T'Challa. 103. Okoye calls for the attack. One of the Dora jumps at Killmonger Panther followed by another Dora. They attack. A third Dora jumps and side kicks Killmonger Panther. The DRAGONFLYER overtakes the Border Tribesmen and begins shooting sonic blasts at T'Challa, that create a large impact on the ground as he runs. The Border Tribesmen continue to run down towards T'Challa and fall into a PHALANX FORMATION. The VIBRANIUM STITCHING on their blankets activates and high tech sonic shields emerge from the blankets and build on each other. The shields stretch out and up, making a barrier impossible for Panther to pass. Panther SUPER JUMPS over the sonic shield as it rises hurdling barely escaping it's vertical edge. He lands behind the 1ST WAVE of Border Tribesmen, delivering a massive sonic blow that sends them flying as well as lifting some of the spilled spears into the air. Panther grabs a spear and with expert precision throws it at the Dragon Flyer. The spear explodes on impact, sending the DRAGONFLYER careening towards the ground right over T'Challa's head. W'Kabi sees this and leads the charge of the 2ND WAVE of Border Tribesmen down towards T'Challa, and they engage him swinging their blades wildly and using their shields to corner him. Ayo and the Dora collide with the 2ND WAVE of Border Tribesmen, fighting them off with precision. Engaging with the Border Tribesmen, T'Challa lands a hard blow on W'Kabi that sends him back through the grass. W'Kabi stop this! Stop this now! W'Kabi runs on top of a large rock to gain a vantage point, and pulls out a large HORN. NOO! ! W'Kabi blows on the horn. 104. We push in on the DRAGONFLYER WRECKAGE, as a rumbling sound is heard. Suddenly ARMORED RHINO #1 crashes through the bit of the wreckage wearing a RED BLANKET. Then a second RHINO, ARMORED RHINO #2, crashes through the other side, bigger and faster than the last and wearing a WHITE BLANKET. The camera continues to push in as BOOM, the Dragonflyer is split into two and M20, W'Kabi's personal rhino, emerges right towards camera. The Border Tribesmen lift their swords and cheer as the Rhinos run past them. W'Kabi hops on, and goes right for the pack of DORA, sending a third of them FLYING!

You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did? No I learn from my enemies — beat them at their own game. You have become them. You will destroy the world, Wakanda included. The world took away everything away from me! Everything I ever loved! But I'm gonna make sure we're even. I'm gonna track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you, and I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt, right next to Zuri. Hatred flashes over T'Challa's eyes as he reengages his mask and the train clears. Killmonger engages his mask, and they leap at each other again.

As the BROKEN SPEAR drops T'Challa catches it with his right hand and slams it into Killmonger's chest, just as both their suits form around them. Killmonger removes his helmet, then looks down at the blade that is buried in his chest. T'Challa, realizing this is it, removes his mask as well. Hell of a move. Killmonger struggles to breathe. 117. My pops said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He promised he was going to show it to me some day. Can you believe that? Kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales. Killmonger winces from the pain. T'Challa stands and picks Killmonger up, dragging him to his feet.

Maybe we can still heal you. Killmonger thinks on this. Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah. Just bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships... 'cause they knew death was better than bondage. Killmonger pulls the knife out of his chest, killing himself instantly. T'Challa looks down at his cousin's now lifeless body and becomes emotional.

In the distance a group of SIX KIDS (mostly Black, some Latino), play three on a rugged basketball hoop. When you said you would take me to California for the first time, I thought you meant Coachella, or Disneyland. Why here? This is where our father killed our uncle. Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be demolished. They are tearing it down. Good. 119. They're not tearing it down... I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused. And that building, and that one over there... This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center. Shuri smiles at the surprise. Nakia will oversee the social outreach... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange. Shuri turns to T'Challa in shock at what this means. You're kidding! T'Challa hits a button on his Kimoyo bead, and the RTF comes out of cloaking, revealing itself to have been parked behind the kids playing basketball. A YOUNG BLACK KID turns back to see the ship as the other kids collectively lose their shit. OAKLAND KID #1 What?! Man what the hell is that? OAKLAND KID #2 That's like a Buggati space ship! OAKLAND KID #3 Woah, it came out of nowhere!!! Did y'all see that? What... They start to run up to the ship and touch it. Unsure at first. OAKLAND KID #1 (O.S.) We can take this back to the house y'all... OAKLAND KID #2 (O.S.) We could pull up to school in this! 120. OAKLAND KID #3 (O.S.) Hey look, we can break it apart and we can sell it! OAKLAND KID #2 (O.S.) On Ebay! OAKLAND KID #3 Everybody get like a million a piece. She starts off towards the kids, walking past the Young Black Kid. Uhhh I wouldn't do that if I were you guys... OAKLAND KID #1 (O.S.) Where you come from? From Wakanda. OAKLAND KID #1 (O.S.) What is a Wakanda? The Young Black Kid approaches T'Challa. Hey yo! Is this yours? Who... who are you?

Scene Action: Several assembly members move around the room preparing for a meeting. Suddenly a hush falls over the hall as the Wakandans enter and walk up to the center pit. 121. My name is King T'Challa, son of King T'Chaka. I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot, we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other. Now more than ever, illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the separates us. In times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe. The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around, bemused, wondering what Wakanda could possibly have to offer. A FRENCH AMBASSADOR can't help but lean into his microphone. With all due respect, King T'Challa, what can a nation of farmers offer to the rest of the world? There are a few chuckles from the gallery. Nakia, Okoye and Ayo share a look. T'Challa smiles. TAG 2
