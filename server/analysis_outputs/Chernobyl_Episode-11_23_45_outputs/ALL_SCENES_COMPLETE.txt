SCENE 1:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. MOSCOW APARTMENT102102
Scene Action: A CIGARETTE - slowly burns in an ashtray. It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth, and content ourselves instead... with stories. The apartment is cramped. Bookshelves. Stacks of scientific journals. Soviet-era furniture. Nicotine wallpaper. In these stories, it doesn't matter who the heroes are. All we want to this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov. And he was the best choice. An arrogant, unpleasant man, he ran the room that night, he gave the orders... and no friends. Or at least not important ones. A CAT pads softly over a TYPEWRITER on a wooden desk. Through an open archway, we see a MAN sitting at a kitchen table. Takes the cigarette from the ashtray. Smokes. And now Dyatlov will spend the next ten years in a prison labour camp. IN THE KITCHEN - the soft tick-tick-tick of a small CLOCK on Soviet-era AUDIO CASSETTE RECORDER. Tape playing. 2. Of course that sentence is doubly unfair. There were far greater criminals than him at work. a bit papery. His hair is thinning in odd patches. And as for what Dyatlov did do, the man doesn't deserve prison. Legasov takes a drag on his cigarette. Listening calmly to his own voice playing back through the recorder. He deserves death. Legasov presses STOP on the recorder. Picks up a small microphone wired to the cassette player. Hits PLAY/RECORD. But instead, ten years for "criminal mismanagement". What does that mean? No one knows and it doesn't matter. What does matter is that to them, justice was done. Because you see? A just world is a sane world. (beat) There is nothing sane about Chernobyl. What happened there, what happened after... even the good we did... all of it... all of it... (beat) Madness. He removes his glasses. Rubs his eyes. Exhausted. I've given you everything I know. They'll try to deny it, the way they always do. Will you prevail? I do not know. I only know you'll do your best to try. FIVE OTHER TAPES on the table, each numbered. Legasov crosses to a WINDOW. Moves the curtain slightly to HIS POV - a CAR parked across the street. The interior LIGHT is on. It's always on. Someone's always there. 3.

----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. MOSCOW APT. BUILDING - NIGHT103103
Scene Action: Moscow is dead quiet. Legasov carefully steps outside, remaing in shadow, holding his COAT closed with his hands. There's a slight bulge. Across the street - THE PARKED CAR. A MAN sits in the car. Dome light on. He's pouring coffee from a thermos into a cup, and while he's distracted, Legasov A DARK ALLEY next to his building. Back in shadows. He moves past the rubbish bins and into a small garden area. Then removes the PACKAGE from inside his coat, and stashes it in a small air vent, well out of view. Nearly time. He removes a single cigarette from a nearly full pack. Tosses the rest of the pack away.

SCENE 5:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT106106
Scene Action: Looking out at the blinking lights of the nearby power plant through a WINDOW. This apartment is simple. Sparse. Flat, powder blue walls. Tiny kitchenette. ON THE WALL - a PHOTO of a young man holding a woman off the ground. She's laughing. Scared. In love. Next to the photo, a calendar. The year is 1986. LYUDMILLA IGNATENKO, 23, emerges from the bathroom. Catching her breath. Sick. But happy. Something beautiful. She peers in to her bedroom, where her husband VASILY, 25, sleeps soundly. Good. She'll tell him later. Oh. Her cigarette in the ashtray. No more smoking. She quickly stubs it out. A growing HISS. Lyudmilla crosses out of frame. We hear tea being poured. 5. THROUGH THE WINDOW - we see but do not hear a small EXPLOSION at the power plant, followed almost instantly by a MASSIVE EXPLOSION that turns night into day. And still, no sound. A mute apocalypse. One second goes by. Lyudmilla re-enters frame. Oblivious. Two seconds. She sits down. Three seconds - SHOCKWAVE - like a massive fist SLAMMING into the side of the building... and she jolts back. The BEDROOM DOOR flings open, and Vasily emerges. Sleeveless undershirt, pyjama bottoms. Confused. The noise. He joins Lyudmilla at the window. Sees... FIRES ringing a terrible crimson-red GLOW at the power plant, as if the building has opened a gate to hell. And rising out of the inferno-- an unnatural, glowing, BRIGHT BLUE COLUMN OF LIGHT, like a beacon shooting straight up into the sky... seemingly to the stars. Dogs begin barking. Apartment lights turn on. Pripyat

SCENE 6:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR #4 - 01:24 AM107107
Scene Action: No sound except distant hissing noises. All we see is SWIRLING WHITE DUST, illuminated by emergency MEN - the control room operators, dressed identically in white uniforms. White paper hats covering their heads. All in the same position. Cowering. Except for one man, who stands. 55 years old, gray mustache, white hair swept back on his head. This is ANATOLY DYATLOV. CLOSE ON DYATLOV - SLOW MOTION - the white dust swirls eerily around his face. He's bewildered. Shell-shocked. Comrade Dyatlov? Comrade Dyatlov? ALEXANDR AKIMOV, 33, black mustache, glasses. Staring at him - saying his name. 6. Comrade Dyatlov? What just happened? I don't know. BRAZHNIK, 20's, enters the control room in a panic. There's a fire in the turbine hall. Something blew up... Dyatlov pauses. Lost in thought? His face is unreadable. Agonizing seconds tick by. Then he turns coldly to Akimov. The turbine hall. The control system tank. Hydrogen. You and Toptunov-- you morons blew the tank. LEONID TOPTUNOV, 25, blond, thin, terrified. His boyish moustache is a struggling, wispy version of Akimov's. No, that's not-- Akimov signals Toptunov not to argue. (to the room) This is an emergency. Everyone stay calm. Our first priority is-- PEREVOZCHENKO, 30's, bursts in. Panting. Frantic. It exploded. We know. Akimov-- are we cooling the reactor core? We shut it down. (MORE) (checks the panel) 7. But the control rods are still-- they're not all the way in-- I disengaged the clutch. I don't-- Perevozchenko watches Akimov and Dyatlov talking about the reactor.. are they out of their minds? Alright. I'll disconnect the servos from the standby console. You two! late 20's, sit together at a control panel. Shell-shocked. Get the backup pumps running. We need water moving through the core. That's all that matters. As Dyatlov heads for the door-- There is no core. Dyatlov stops. Turns. Everyone in the room stares. Two TRAINEES, PROSKURYAKOV and KUDRYAVTSEV, both 30, look at each other. For the first time, real fear. It exploded. The core exploded. A beat, then Dyatlov shakes his head in disgust. He's in shock. Get him out of here. The lid is off. The stack is burning. I saw it. (calmly) You're confused. RBMK reactor cores don't explode. Akimov... Akimov hesitates. Stares at the control panel. A plastic cover is lifted up over a large black switch labeled AZ-5. Then he looks at young, frightened Toptunov. Don't worry, Leonid. We did everything right. Something-- something strange has happened. 8. Toptunov grabs Akimov's arm. Whispers to him. Do you taste metal? Akimov. Comrade Perevozschenko, what you're saying is physically impossible. A core can't explode. It has to be the tank. Perevozchenko looks at Akimov in disbelief. We're wasting time. LET'S GO. Get the hydrogen out of the generators, and pump water into the core. As Dyatlov turns to exit-- What about the fire? Dyatlov looks back at him. Annoyed. Call the fire brigade. Dyaltov EXITS.

SCENE 7:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM 4 - CONTINUOUS108108
Scene Action: Battery-powered emergency lights shine into swirls of dust. We hear a distant ALARM blaring. Someone's shouting. DYATLOV - strides with purpose. No emotion. Stone cold. Then A SMALL LANDING with a WINDOW. The glass has been BLOWN IN, and shards litter the floor. Dyatlov walks slowly across the broken glass to the window... He walks up to the open window. Looks at the grounds below. Chunks of DEBRIS litter the ground. Hard to tell in the moonlight just what it is. But some of it is BURNING. 9. Dyatlov stares at the debris for a moment. Then calmly turns and continues down the hall.

Scene Name: EXT. CHERNOBYL POWER PLANT - CONTINUOUS109109
Scene Action: THE BURNING RUBBLE - thick black chunks of GRAPHITE, with smooth channels carved through them. REACTOR BUILDING #4 - and the massive GAPING HOLE in its side - tons of steel and graphite and plaster and cinderblock vomited out from the blast... FIRES burn in scattered pockets where red-hot graphite has ignited the tar-covered roof. Pouring out from somewhere inside the building, BLACK SMOKE. And still, the awful scarlet glow. And still, the impossible BEACON of BLUE LIGHT spiring up... tone. The tone stops as a new audio signal is connected. Then - voices over a phone or perhaps a radio, speaking Russian. This is a recording of the actual call made that night. Hello, is this Military Fire Station 2? MILITARY FIRE STATION 2 Yes. What's happening with the accident? MILITARY FIRE STATION 2 Explosion in the main building between third and fourth blocks. Are there people there? MILITARY FIRE STATION 2 Yes. 10. (We hear another voice on the military fire station end) Wake up the bosses. Call them. MILITARY FIRE STATION 2 I already called mine. Wake them up, wake them all up. Wake up the entire officer's block. AUDIO TONE - then a new call Fire Department. Hello, Ivankov? Yes. Yes? You've been called to Pripyat. Hello? Yes. Yes I can hear you. At the nuclear plant over there, in the third and fourth blocks. The roof is on fire. AUDIO TONE - call ends

Scene Name: INT. LYUDMILLA AND VASILY'S APARTMENT - N OW111111
Scene Action: --in a CLOSET, looking out at VASILY, in a t-shirt and uniform pants. He grabs his boots. Lyudmilla watches him nervously. You're not on call tonight. He hustles to get his boots on. 11. They're bringing everyone in. Military and civil. Pripyat, Polesskoe. Even Kiev. It's a big one. It doesn't look right. The color. Pravik thinks they're shining floodlights or something. But are there chemicals? He pulls on his jacket. Chemicals? No, the problem's the roof. It's covered in tar. It's going to burn all night and stink like hell. But that's the worst of it. She opens her mouth to say something, but he takes her face in his hands. Gives her a kiss. Go to sleep. It'll be over before you wake.

SCENE 10:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: INT. INSIDE REACTOR BUILDING #4 - SAME TIME114114
Scene Action: Dark hallway. Smoke. Sparks shower down from severed electric lines arcing into flooding water. Steam hissing. PEREVOZCHENKO lurches into view. We LEAD him through the twisted, mangled maze. A disaster area of debris, collapsed ceilings, spurting steam... But he pushes through until he gets to an OPEN DOOR - and we DOSIMETRY - NIKOLAI GORBACHENKO is cowering under his desk. SPARKS exploding down from a hole in the ceiling. Is it war? Perevozchenko searches frantically through the debris. 12. Where's the dosimeter? Here... here... Gorbachenko crawls out and hands Perevozchenko a brown leather case with the DOSIMETER. We hear something heavy COLLAPSING above them. Gorbachenko flinches. Are they bombing? Perevozchenko doesn't answer. Just stares at the dosimeter in disbelief. What the fuck is this? 3.6 roentgen? That's as high as it goes. The good one's locked in a safe. I don't have the key-- (sees) Valera-- your face... Perevozchenko's face has DARKENED. A reddish brown TAN. He doesn't know. Doesn't care. He throws the useless dosimeter aside and grabs Gorbachenko, lifting him to his feet. I'm going to find Khodemchuk. You get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go. Go! Perevozchenko wanders DOWN A TUNNEL away from us and we swing around to Gorbachenko, who is terrified. Now WE FOLLOW GORBACHENKO as he heads up a steep staircase into DARKNESS - coming around on him so we're leading him, watching his face as it's illuminated by sparks and the orange flicker of SPOT FIRES... A MAN LURCHES OUT OF THE DARKNESS into Gorbachenko and VOMITS BLOOD in a violent ejection, spattering Gorbachenko's white uniform with red. Shit! The man stumbles away from us, and we WHIP around to PROSKURYAKOV and KUDRYAVTSEV, the trainees, running down the stairs at us. 13. We need to get to the reactor hall. The lift's destroyed. (points) Across to the stairs. That way. The trainees run off in that direction. Gorbachenko yells after them... Why are you going there? The number 604 stencilled in the concrete beside it. We follow him in to the DEVASTATED ROOM - debris everywhere, and in a puddle of water, under a fallen BEAM-- Oh god. SHASHENOK - pinned. Bloody foam bubbling from his mouth. But breathing. A FIGURE STUMBLES BY in the doorway. Gorbachenko sees. HEY! A BUILDING 4 WORKER STUMBLES BACK - trickle of blood down the side of his face. DUST in his hair. Help me. The Building 4 Worker joins Gorbachenko. They ROLL the beam off Shashenok, then PULL HIM UP by his arms... They support him from under each armpit, his arms around their necks. Gorbachenko presses Shashenok's RIGHT HAND tight --we LEAVE THEM and DROP DOWN through a HOLE in the floor, past a cross-section of torn up plumbing and wires, and PEREVOZCHENKO - his face even DARKER now - skin beginning to swell - wading through more floodwater and debris, including CHUNKS of BLACK MATERIAL... From somewhere, the steady sound of BANG, BANG, BANG - metal on metal... 14. BANG - a bent metal DOOR pops open, and a new face - YUVCHENKO, emerges holding a fire extinguisher. Have you seen Khodemchuk? No-- where's Viktor? Perevozchenko starts to shake his head "I don't know" - then vomit cascades out from his mouth, his nose. Yuvchenko backs away in fright, drops the extinguisher and-- --now WE FOLLOW YUVCHENKO, 25 years-old, 6'5", powerful and athletic, as he RUNS deeper into the complex, jumping over LIVE WIRES and debris, as fast as he can... until he sees-- VIKTOR? VIKTOR? VIKTOR DEGTYARENKO, 31 - burned and covered in blood... we can barely make out a face at all beyond the whites of his eyes. He's trembling. Seizing. Can you stand? Kh-- dem-ch-- Khdem-- Viktor stops trying to make his mouth work. His eyes roll to the left - toward a BLASTED OPEN WALL. Yuvchenko stands up, and we FOLLOW as he walks slowly through THE PUMP ROOM - in ruins. Massive chunks of concrete embedded in the enormous machinery. From underneath one massive column, a steady trickle of blood. We can't see Khodemchuk under there. But we know he's dead. One section of wall - three foot thick concrete and rebar - rocks back and forth as if it were rubber. ground, coming from a broken pipe. 15. In the reflection of the shimmering water - strange WHITE We come up and around on Yuvchenko and look down on him as he lifts his head - stunned beyond words-- And we TURN to see what he sees. An enormous, impossible hole in the ceiling of the building. And the stars shining down.

Perevozchenko wanders DOWN A TUNNEL away from us and we swing around to Gorbachenko, who is terrified. Now WE FOLLOW GORBACHENKO as he heads up a steep staircase into DARKNESS - coming around on him so we're leading him, watching his face as it's illuminated by sparks and the orange flicker of SPOT FIRES... A MAN LURCHES OUT OF THE DARKNESS into Gorbachenko and VOMITS BLOOD in a violent ejection, spattering Gorbachenko's white uniform with red. Shit! The man stumbles away from us, and we WHIP around to PROSKURYAKOV and KUDRYAVTSEV, the trainees, running down the stairs at us. 13. We need to get to the reactor hall. The lift's destroyed. (points) Across to the stairs. That way. The trainees run off in that direction. Gorbachenko yells after them... Why are you going there? The number 604 stencilled in the concrete beside it. We follow him in to the DEVASTATED ROOM - debris everywhere, and in a puddle of water, under a fallen BEAM-- Oh god. SHASHENOK - pinned. Bloody foam bubbling from his mouth. But breathing. A FIGURE STUMBLES BY in the doorway. Gorbachenko sees. HEY! A BUILDING 4 WORKER STUMBLES BACK - trickle of blood down the side of his face. DUST in his hair. Help me. The Building 4 Worker joins Gorbachenko. They ROLL the beam off Shashenok, then PULL HIM UP by his arms... They support him from under each armpit, his arms around their necks. Gorbachenko presses Shashenok's RIGHT HAND tight --we LEAVE THEM and DROP DOWN through a HOLE in the floor, past a cross-section of torn up plumbing and wires, and PEREVOZCHENKO - his face even DARKER now - skin beginning to swell - wading through more floodwater and debris, including CHUNKS of BLACK MATERIAL... From somewhere, the steady sound of BANG, BANG, BANG - metal on metal... 14. BANG - a bent metal DOOR pops open, and a new face - YUVCHENKO, emerges holding a fire extinguisher. Have you seen Khodemchuk? No-- where's Viktor? Perevozchenko starts to shake his head "I don't know" - then vomit cascades out from his mouth, his nose. Yuvchenko backs away in fright, drops the extinguisher and-- --now WE FOLLOW YUVCHENKO, 25 years-old, 6'5", powerful and athletic, as he RUNS deeper into the complex, jumping over LIVE WIRES and debris, as fast as he can... until he sees-- VIKTOR? VIKTOR? VIKTOR DEGTYARENKO, 31 - burned and covered in blood... we can barely make out a face at all beyond the whites of his eyes. He's trembling. Seizing. Can you stand? Kh-- dem-ch-- Khdem-- Viktor stops trying to make his mouth work. His eyes roll to the left - toward a BLASTED OPEN WALL. Yuvchenko stands up, and we FOLLOW as he walks slowly through THE PUMP ROOM - in ruins. Massive chunks of concrete embedded in the enormous machinery. From underneath one massive column, a steady trickle of blood. We can't see Khodemchuk under there. But we know he's dead. One section of wall - three foot thick concrete and rebar - rocks back and forth as if it were rubber. ground, coming from a broken pipe. 15. In the reflection of the shimmering water - strange WHITE We come up and around on Yuvchenko and look down on him as he lifts his head - stunned beyond words-- And we TURN to see what he sees. An enormous, impossible hole in the ceiling of the building. And the stars shining down.

(frustrated) 16. What about the pumps? I can't get through to Khodemchuk. The phones are down. Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk. Are the pumps on or not? Stolyarchuk? STOLYARCHUK, looks up like a deer in the headlights. Doesn't want Dyatlov's eyes on him. My panel's not working. I tried calling for the electricians but-- I don't give a shit about the panel! I need water in my reactor core. Get down there and make sure those pumps are on. Stolyarchuk looks at Akimov, but Akimov won't look back. No one will challenge this. Kirschenbaum wants to say something, but the words stick in his throat. Now. Cowed, Stolyarchuk scurries out of the control room. Dyatlov turns back to Akimov. What does the dosimeter say? 3.6 roentgen. But that's as high as the meter-- Dyatlov waves him off. 3.6 -- not great, not terrible. Toptunov looks at Akimov. Scared.

Firefighters are rushing... connecting fire engines to the power plant water supply... We follow VASILY out of the truck. He and his fellow firefighters are dressed the same. Boots and jackets and helmets... but no gloves. And underneath the jackets... white t-shirts. He looks at the building. From here, he can see the spot fires up on the roof. But there's a MASSIVE plume of smoke billowing up from somewhere inside the building. And fainter now, but still there, the trace of that impossible blue light... Now that he's close to it, Vasily realizes this is much bigger, and much worse, than it seemed from afar. Vasily... Vasily looks over at MISHA, 23, another firefighter. Misha is standing next to a pile of the BLACK RUBBLE. There are strange SMOOTH GROOVES running through it. It almost looks like bits of SCULPTURE. What is this? Misha picks up a piece of the rubble with his bare hand. It's warm. I don't know. Don't fuck around with it. Let's just get these hooked up. Misha tosses the rubble aside. Vasily begins pulling connection hoses from the side of the engine. As he pulls, the smoke wafts by him, and he SPITS. You taste metal? 18. Yeah. What is that? (worried) I don't know. The valves, Misha! Let's go! As Vasily pulls the hoses, MISHA starts opening a water supply valve with a wrench. Misha takes his hand off the wrench-- the hand he held the warm rubble with-- and SHAKES it in the air. It hurts. It hurts more than it should.

And spidering out from its exposed underside, hundreds of TWISTED FUEL CHANNELS, like bristles on the end of a brush. THE OPEN REACTOR PIT - burning graphite, torn fuel rods. Their minds cannot comprehend. They are staring into a wide-open nuclear reactor. One of them finally gasps in a breath. Already feeling a wave of nausea. He looks at the other trainee. The man's face is dark brown. An instant nuclear tan. And the way the other trainee is staring back at him, he knows he looks the same. 21. They STUMBLE BACKWARD...

Ten women went into labour at the same time-- did I ever tell you this story? Zinchenko's still staring out the window. Distracted. Yes. The old doctor is a bit hurt by that. Well, I won't need you in here for a while. If you want, get some rest in the break room. 28. He opens one of the patient's charts. Begins making handwritten notations. Zinchenko finally turns to him. They haven't brought anyone in from the fire. What fire? The power plant. Oh? Then it must not be too bad. Do we stock iodine? He didn't hear that over the woman's groaning. Hmm? (louder) Iodine. He looks up from his chart. You mean disinfectant? No. Pills. Does the hospital stock iodine pills? Iodine pills... (confused) Why would we have iodine pills?

Bryukhanov sees Dyatlov waiting for them in the room. (pissed off) I take it the safety test was a failure? Bryukhanov sits at the head of the table. Fomin takes a chair next to him-- his sidekick-- and scowls at Dyatlov. We have the situation under control. 31. Under control? It doesn't look-- Shut up, Fomin. (miserable) I have to tell the Central Committee about this. Do you realize that? I have to get on a phone and tell Maryin, or god forbid Frolyshev, my power plant is on fire? No one can blame you for this, Director Bryukhanov. Well of course no one can blame me for this. How can I be responsible? I was sleeping! Bryukhanov pulls out a pen and notepad from his jacket pocket. Tell me what happened. Quickly. We ran the test exactly as Chief Engineer Fomin approved. Fomin sees what Dyatlov just did there. Motherfucker. Unit Shift Chief Akimov and Engineer Toptunov encountered technical difficulties, leading to an accumulation of hydrogen in the control system tank. It regrettably ignited, damaging the plant and setting the roof on fire. Bryukhanov glances at Fomin. Does that sound right? The tank is quite large. It's the only logical explanation. And of course, Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov was directly supervising the test-- Dyatlov registers the return fire. Touché. 32. --so he would know best. (taking notes) --hydrogen tank, fire. And the reactor? We're taking measures to ensure a steady flow of water through the core. What about radiation? Obviously down here it's nothing. But in the reactor building I'm being told 3.6 roentgen per hour. That's not great. But it's not horrifying. Not at all. From the feedwater, I assume? Dyatlov nods. We'll have to limit shifts to six hours at a time. But otherwise-- The dosimetrists should be checking regularly. Have them use the good meter. From the safe. Dyatlov blinks at that. But otherwise... no reaction. Bryukhanov pulls a phone closer to him. Right. I'll call Maryin. (to Fomin) Wake up the local Executive Committee. There'll be orders coming down. 33. Bryukhanov takes a short breath... steels himself... then picks up the phone.

They all watch the fire. Calm. Peaceful, even. It is beautiful... The wind picks up, breezing through their hair. And with it, swirls of soot in the air, like tiny bits of paper. SLOW MOTION - as the particles swirl around them. The people stand there on the bridge, just a mile from the burning power plant, laughing, drinking... Children laugh and run in circles, trying to grab the black snowflakes of floating soot from the air. Mikhail, watches excitedly, his baby now in his arms. The infant stares calmly at the distant light.

Scene Action: Bryukhanov, Fomin and Dyatlov are waiting-- then Bryukhanov enters. Twelve men, ages varying from 30 to 60. Gentlemen, welcome. Please, find a seat, there's plenty of room-- The COMMITTEE MEMBERS take their chairs around the conference table. A guard helps an ELDERLY MAN WITH A CANE - 85 years old - over to a single, nicer chair in the corner of the room. I apologize for the lateness of the hour. And rest assured, we're all very safe down here. We built this shelter to withstand a nuclear attack by the Americans, so I think we'll be fine. Some of the Members smile. Most do not. The Old Man in the corner has his hands folded over his cane. Eyes closed. Possibly already asleep. As you can see, we have experienced an accident. A large control tank malfunctioned, damaging reactor building #4 and starting a fire. I have spoken directly to Deputy Secretary Maryin. Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev, Frolyshev to Central Committee member Dolghikh, and Dolghikh to General Secretary Gorbachev. An impressive murmur in the room. This is big time. Because the Central Committee has the greatest respect for the work of the Pripyat Executive Committee, they have asked me to brief you on matters as they stand. First, the accident is well under control. 40. Most of the Members express relief. Second, because the efforts of the Soviet nuclear industry are considered key state secrets, it is important that we ensure this incident has no adverse consequences. The Members glance at each other. Here it comes. To prevent a panic, the Central Committee has ordered a detachment of military police to Pripyat. And there it is. PETROV, 30, displeased, speaks up. How large of a detachment? (uncomfortable) Between two and four thousand men. Whispers. Quiet crosstalk. Four thousand? Martial law? Why so many police? What's really going on here? How dangerous is this? There's mild radiation, but it's limited to the plant itself. No it isn't. Excuse me? (stands) I said no it isn't. Who do you think you're talking to? Some country idiot? I went to university. And I have eyes in my head. (to the Committee) 41. You saw men outside vomiting. You saw men with burns. There's more radiation than they're saying. We have wives here. We have children. I say we evacuate the town. More whispers. Evacuate? To where? No, he's right-- no, he's insane, an alarmist! Gentlemen, please! My wife is here. Do you think I would keep her in Pripyat if it weren't safe? Bryukhanov-- the fucking air is glowing! More crosstalk. Voices rising now. Bryukhanov has lost control of the room. Dyatlov tries to step in. The Cherenkov effect-- it's a completely normal phenomenon, it can happen with minimal radiation-- No one listens to him. Loudly arguing with each other now. the floor. Everyone quiets down. The old man is ZHARKOV. He makes a motion to stand. The guard comes over quickly to help him up, but Zharkov waves him off. I wonder-- how many of you know the name of this place? We all call it "Chernobyl" of course, but what is its proper name? The Vladimir I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station. Exactly. Vladimir I. Lenin. And how proud he would be of you tonight-- (to Petrov) 42. --especially you, young man... and the passion you have for the people. For is that not the sole purpose of the apparatus of the State? Zharkov looks at them, his old eyes twinkling with memories of great days... of great men... From the Central Committee all the way down to each of us in this room-- we represent the perfect expression of the collective will of the Soviet proletariat. The Members take this in. Sobered.

The State tells us they do not want a panic. Listen well. Zharkov turns to Petrov once again. True, when the people see police, they will be scared. But it is my experience that when the people ask questions that are not in their own best interest, they should simply be told to keep their minds on their labour-- and to leave matters of the State to the State.

Petrov looks across the table at another younger Committee Member. They both seem to understand that reason has lost. There's no choice but to clap along with everyone else. Applause for delusion. Applause for death. Applause for the Vladimir I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station.

Complete Content: Bryukhanov, Fomin and Dyatlov are waiting-- then Bryukhanov enters. Twelve men, ages varying from 30 to 60. Gentlemen, welcome. Please, find a seat, there's plenty of room-- The COMMITTEE MEMBERS take their chairs around the conference table. A guard helps an ELDERLY MAN WITH A CANE - 85 years old - over to a single, nicer chair in the corner of the room. I apologize for the lateness of the hour. And rest assured, we're all very safe down here. We built this shelter to withstand a nuclear attack by the Americans, so I think we'll be fine. Some of the Members smile. Most do not. The Old Man in the corner has his hands folded over his cane. Eyes closed. Possibly already asleep. As you can see, we have experienced an accident. A large control tank malfunctioned, damaging reactor building #4 and starting a fire. I have spoken directly to Deputy Secretary Maryin. Maryin spoke to Deputy Chief Frolyshev, Frolyshev to Central Committee member Dolghikh, and Dolghikh to General Secretary Gorbachev. An impressive murmur in the room. This is big time. Because the Central Committee has the greatest respect for the work of the Pripyat Executive Committee, they have asked me to brief you on matters as they stand. First, the accident is well under control. 40. Most of the Members express relief. Second, because the efforts of the Soviet nuclear industry are considered key state secrets, it is important that we ensure this incident has no adverse consequences. The Members glance at each other. Here it comes. To prevent a panic, the Central Committee has ordered a detachment of military police to Pripyat. And there it is. PETROV, 30, displeased, speaks up. How large of a detachment? (uncomfortable) Between two and four thousand men. Whispers. Quiet crosstalk. Four thousand? Martial law? Why so many police? What's really going on here? How dangerous is this? There's mild radiation, but it's limited to the plant itself. No it isn't. Excuse me? (stands) I said no it isn't. Who do you think you're talking to? Some country idiot? I went to university. And I have eyes in my head. (to the Committee) 41. You saw men outside vomiting. You saw men with burns. There's more radiation than they're saying. We have wives here. We have children. I say we evacuate the town. More whispers. Evacuate? To where? No, he's right-- no, he's insane, an alarmist! Gentlemen, please! My wife is here. Do you think I would keep her in Pripyat if it weren't safe? Bryukhanov-- the fucking air is glowing! More crosstalk. Voices rising now. Bryukhanov has lost control of the room. Dyatlov tries to step in. The Cherenkov effect-- it's a completely normal phenomenon, it can happen with minimal radiation-- No one listens to him. Loudly arguing with each other now. the floor. Everyone quiets down. The old man is ZHARKOV. He makes a motion to stand. The guard comes over quickly to help him up, but Zharkov waves him off. I wonder-- how many of you know the name of this place? We all call it "Chernobyl" of course, but what is its proper name? The Vladimir I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station. Exactly. Vladimir I. Lenin. And how proud he would be of you tonight-- (to Petrov) 42. --especially you, young man... and the passion you have for the people. For is that not the sole purpose of the apparatus of the State? Zharkov looks at them, his old eyes twinkling with memories of great days... of great men... From the Central Committee all the way down to each of us in this room-- we represent the perfect expression of the collective will of the Soviet proletariat. The Members take this in. Sobered. But proud. Sometimes, we forget. Sometimes, we fall prey to fear. But our faith in Soviet socialism will always be rewarded. Always. The State tells us the situation is not dangerous. Have faith. The State tells us they do not want a panic. Listen well. Zharkov turns to Petrov once again. True, when the people see police, they will be scared.

He sees Sitnikov waiting. What's this guy doing here? A guard whispers to Bryukhanov. Ah. Fine. Bryukhanov signals for Sitnikov to enter.

Scene Name: INT. BUNKER COMMAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS142142
Scene Action: Sitnikov enters. Sees Fomin and Dyatlov there. Well? I sent my dosimetrists into the reactor building. The large dosimeter from the safe, the one with the thousand roentgen capac-- (snaps) What was the number? 44. There was none. The meter burned out the second it was turned on. Dyatlov shrugs. Suddenly calm. Typical. See? This is what Moscow does. They send us shit equipment, and they wonder why things go wrong. We found another dosimeter. Dyatlov tenses again. From the military fire department. It only goes to 200 roentgen, but it's better than the small ones. And? Sitnikov hesitates. All his life, he's been warned not to be the bearer of bad news. It maxed out. Two hundred roentgen. What game are you playing? No-- I asked him, he took multiple measurements, my best man-- It's another faulty meter. You're wasting our time. I checked the meter against a control-- What's wrong with you? How do you get that number from feedwater leaking from a blown tank? 45. You don't. Then what the fuck are you talking about? I walked around the exterior of building 4. I think there's graphite. In the rubble. Bryukhanov looks at Fomin and Dyatlov, who scoff. You didn't see graphite. I did. You didn't. YOU DIDN'T. Because it's NOT THERE. Fomin steps in. A calmer voice. Are you suggesting the core-- what? Exploded? Yes. Sitnikov. You're a nuclear engineer. So am I. Please tell me how an RBMK reactor core "explodes". Not a meltdown-- an explosion. I'd love to know. I can't. Are you stupid? No. Then why can't you? 46. I don't-- I don't see how it could explode. Fomin throws up his arms. Looks at Bryukhanov. See? Not possible. But it did. Dyatlov slams his fist down on the table. Enough! They all turn to him. Startled. I'll go up to the vent block roof. From there, you can look right down into Reactor Building 4. I'll see it with my own eyes. He VOMITS violently. The others move back in shock. Dyatlov stares at the vomit on the floor. In a daze. I apologize. He tries to lean on the table for support, but misses completely and COLLAPSES to the ground. Guards! Three guards run in. Take him to the medic. Or the hospital. Whatever he needs. Two of the guards lift Dyatlov off the floor. Begin helping him walk out. Dyatlov has a strange look on his face. We've seen it before. Right after the explosion. Bewildered. (to Bryukhanov) 47. It's the feedwater. He's been around it all night. Bryukhanov nods. Then Fomin glances at Sitnikov. You go then. What? Go to the vent block roof and report back what you see. No. No, I won't do that. Fomin and Bryukhanov stare at him. Did he just say "no"? Of course you will. Bryukhanov looks to the remaining guard. Gives him a "make sure he does it" nod. Sitnikov turns pale. No way out of this. You'll be fine. You'll see... No he won't. Sitnikov turns, looks at the guard... then walks out. Like a man going to the gallows. The guard follows him.

They're straining to make them move at all. All the way, okay? All the way open. No sound but that awful, distant hissing, and the sharp metal I'm sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. I told you-- we did nothing wrong. But we did. Akimov stops turning his valve. Doesn't answer. Doesn't look at Toptunov. Just stands quietly for a second. Then puts his hands back on the valve and resumes turning.

Closes his eyes. A prayer-- or a memory-- or a goodbye. Then he opens his eyes, and-- BEHIND SITNIKOV - we watch as he walks to the edge. He looks over. Just for a second.

Healthy color. He gets out of bed, crosses out of his room, makes his way into the kitchen, and answers the phone. Hello? Valery Legasov? Yes? You are the Legasov who is the First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy? Legasov feels his pajama shirt pocket for his glasses. But left them back in the bedroom. Yes. That's-- He picks up the table clock to get it closer to his eyes. Who am I spea-- ? 51. This is Boris Shcherbina, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and head of the Bureau for Fuel and Energy. There's been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Legasov is immediately alert. How bad is it? No need to panic. There was a fire. It's mostly put out. The system control tank exploded. Control system tank. Is the core-- ? We've ordered them to continuously pump water. I see. And contamination? Mild. The plant manager, Bryukhanov, is reporting 3.6 roentgen per hour. Well, no, that's-- that's actually quite significant. The surrounding areas should be evacuated-- (cuts him off) You're an expert on RBMK reactors, correct? Yes, I've studied-- General Secretary Gorbachev has appointed a committee to manage the accident. You're on it. We'll convene at two this afternoon. 52. (concerned) That late? I'm sorry, but I think given the radiation you're reporting, it might be best to-- Legasov. You're on this committee to answer direct questions about the function of an RBMK reactor if they should happen to arise. Nothing else. Certainly not policy. Do you understand? Yes. Of course. I didn't mean to-- Click. Shcherbina has hung up. Legasov hangs up as well and rises. Gears already spinning. 3.6 roentgen... ? A strange number. The control system tank? It makes no sense. He moves to his window. Opens the curtains to the SUNRISE.
