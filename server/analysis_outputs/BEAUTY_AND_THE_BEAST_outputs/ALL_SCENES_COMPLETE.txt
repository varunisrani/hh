Can I give you a little advice about the villagers, though? They’re never going to trust the kind of change we’re trying to bring. Pursuing her into her garden, he trampling cabbages. All I wanted was to teach a child to read. The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own. Belle looks for a way out. She doesn’t like where this is going. 17. I’m not ready to have children. Maybe you haven't met the right man. It's a small village, Gaston. I've met them all. Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed. She climbs the steps to her cottage door. Gaston follows close behind. Gaston, we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much. Belle, do you know what happens to spinsters in our village after their fathers die? Gaston motions to the street, where we find AGATHE, a “alms for the poor?” They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn’t get any better. I might be a farm girl, but I’m not simple. I’m sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston. Gaston keeps the gallant smile plastered as she shuts the door in his face.

Maurice and Philippe speed through the gates as the wolves skid to a stop, their HOWLS turning to YELPS OF FEAR.

While I pay my respects to our unwitting host... whoever that may be... He leaves. Philippe stares uneasily at a statue of a horse.

Forgive me, I don’t mean to intrude. I need shelter from the storm. Hello? Maurice puts his hat and coat on a COAT RACK at the entrance. Maurice turns, not seeing the coat rack shake the snow off. Maurice explores, scanning the room and its FURNITURE -- TABLES, CHAIRS, A FEATHER DUSTER. A MANTLE CLOCK AND CANDELABRA SIT ON A TABLE. As Maurice passes them, the candelabra slowly TURNS -- as if watching him. This is LUMIÈRE, formerly head footman to the Prince. LUMIÈRE Must have lost his way in the woods... The candelabra continues craning -- while the mantle clock beside it remains rigid. Meet COGSWORTH, every bit the stiff- upper-lip majordomo. (whispers) Shut up, you idiot. Hearing this, Maurice spins -- but sees only an ordinary candelabra and clock on the table. Curious, he approaches, leaning down to the clock... Mm... extraordinary. He picks up the candelabra, inspecting it. This is beautiful... An echo of eerie harpsichord music makes Maurice turn toward the ballroom. He places the candelabra back down and exits. LUMIÈRE A man of taste. He was talking about me. 22.

He looks terribly pale and sick, coughing. Belle? How did you find me!? Belle puts the candelabra down and clutches his hands. 26. Oh, your hands are ice. We need to get you home. Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! Who?! The beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle searches the shadows. The voice circles her. Who’s there? Who are you? Who are you? I’ve come for my father. Your father is a thief. Liar! In Belle’s wide eyes, we see her guilt. I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him! No, he means forever. Apparently that’s what happens around here when you pick a flower. A life sentence for a rose? I received eternal damnation for one. I’m merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father’s place? 27. Come into the light. The figure remains still. Belle grabs hold of Lumiere and thrusts the candle forward, illuminating a HIDEOUS HORNED FACE. Belle’s eyes go wide as she clearly sees THE BEAST. The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE. DEEP. SOULFUL. And flicked with pain when he sees Belle’s revulsion. CHOOSE! Belle, I won’t let you do this. I lost your mother. I won’t lose you too. Now go! Maurice falls into a terrible coughing fit. Alright, Papa. I will leave. (to the beast) I need a minute alone with him. The beast doesn’t respond. Are you so cold-hearted that you won’t allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? (off his proud grunt) Forever can spare a minute! Intrigued by her defiance, the beast moves toward her, reaching out with his massive paw. Belle closes her eyes, bracing herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- Belle opens her eyes to find herself eye to eye with the beast’s chest. He has reached high above her head to pull down an iron lever, unlocking the door. When this door closes, it will not open again.

Complete Content: Belle follows the cough up a labyrinth of stairs until she reaches the dark prison tower and a GRATED IRON DOOR. Papa!? Is that you? Belle sees Maurice through a grate in the door. He looks terribly pale and sick, coughing. Belle? How did you find me!? Belle puts the candelabra down and clutches his hands. 26. Oh, your hands are ice. We need to get you home. Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! Who?! The beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle searches the shadows. The voice circles her. Who’s there? Who are you? Who are you? I’ve come for my father. Your father is a thief. Liar! In Belle’s wide eyes, we see her guilt. I asked for the rose. Punish me, not him! No, he means forever. Apparently that’s what happens around here when you pick a flower. A life sentence for a rose? I received eternal damnation for one. I’m merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father’s place? 27. Come into the light. The figure remains still. Belle grabs hold of Lumiere and thrusts the candle forward, illuminating a HIDEOUS HORNED FACE. Belle’s eyes go wide as she clearly sees THE BEAST. The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE. DEEP. SOULFUL. And flicked with pain when he sees Belle’s revulsion. CHOOSE! Belle, I won’t let you do this. I lost your mother. I won’t lose you too. Now go! Maurice falls into a terrible coughing fit. Alright, Papa. I will leave. (to the beast) I need a minute alone with him. The beast doesn’t respond. Are you so cold-hearted that you won’t allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? (off his proud grunt) Forever can spare a minute! Intrigued by her defiance, the beast moves toward her, reaching out with his massive paw. Belle closes her eyes, bracing herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- Belle opens her eyes to find herself eye to eye with the beast’s chest. He has reached high above her head to pull down an iron lever, unlocking the door. When this door closes, it will not open again.

Scene Action: Belle rushes in and embraces her father. 28. I should have been with you. Belle, listen to me. It’s all right. Live your life. Forget me. Forget you? Everything I am is because of you. I love you, Belle. Don’t be afraid. I love you too, Papa... She pulls him close. I’m not afraid. (whispers) And I will escape, I promise. What?! With that, she pivots and swings her father through the door just as the beast slams it shut. Maurice trips to the ground, giving the beast a second to turn to Belle. They lock eyes. You took his place. He is my father. He’s a fool. So are you. The beast turns and drags Maurice away. Don’t hurt him! Through the latticework, Belle sees the beast and her father disappear down the corridor. She rushes to the window and watches the beast carry her father down the spiral staircase of the prison tower. Belle! I’ll come back! I promise! Once she is alone, Belle cannot help herself. She slumps to the floor and the tears come. We FADE OUT. 29.

Scene Action: Belle huddles in the corner. The cell door swings opens. LUMIÈRE (O.S.) Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room. Belle wipes her tears and stands. She grabs a small stool, ready to strike. My room? But I thought -- LUMIÈRE (O.S.) What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic. Belle bounds out of the cell, raising the stool to hit a grown man. Instead, she sees... a candelabra wave at her. LUMIÈRE ‘Allo. AHHH! Like seeing a mouse, Belle bashes the candelabra. It grunts as it clatters on the stone floor. The candles extinguished. WHOOSH -- the first candle relights. WHOOSH -- the second. Illuminated by the two arm candles, Belle makes out EYES and a rudimentary “FACE” in the design. LUMIÈRE (recovering) Oh, you are very strong. That’s a great quality! What are you? The arms light the main candle to reveal a rakish smile. LUMIÈRE I am Lumière. And you can talk. Cogsworth appears, out of breath. 30. Of course he can talk, it’s all he ever does! Now Lumiere, as head of the household, I demand that you put her back in the cell at once! Officially freaked out now, Belle retreats to her cell, in search of a better weapon. LUMIÈRE What do you want to be for the rest mantle clock? They turn back to Belle, re-emerging from the cell. LUMIÈRE Ready, miss? (to Cogsworth) Trust me.

But consider me at your service. The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like -- Except the west wing! Lumière throws him a ‘would-you-please-shut-up’ look. Which we do not have. Why, what’s in the west wing? È 31. LUMIÈRE Uh... nothing. Storage space. That’s it. Belle looks back at the spooky tower of the west wing. LUMIÈRE This way, please! To the east wing.

Scene Name: INT. BELLE’S BEDROOM - CASTLE - EVENING4646
Scene Action: -- the most beautiful, magical room she’s ever seen. The entire ceiling is a painting of white clouds in a blue sky. There is a LARGE DRESSER and a COMFORTABLE BED. Opulence. It’s... beautiful. LUMIÈRE Of course. Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle. Lumière leaps onto the bed and - POOF - dust fills the air. LUMIÈRE Oh dear! We were not expecting guests. PLUMETTE, a feather duster, swoops into the room, giving the surfaces a quick dusting. 32. Enchanté, Mademoiselle! Don't worry, I'll have this room spotless in no time! She lands in the arms of Lumière, whose candles burn a little hotter once she speaks in her sexy French accent. (sotto) This plan of yours is... dangerous. LUMIÈRE I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette. He moves to embrace her, but she stops him. No, my love. I've been burned by you before. We must be strong. LUMIÈRE How can I be strong when you make me so weak? Cogsworth clears his throat. Belle backs away from the strange creatures. Is everything here alive? (picks up a HAIR BRUSH) Hello, what’s your name? Cogsworth looks up at her, puzzled. Um... that’s a hair brush. Belle hears a loud SNORE behind her, and turns to see the DRESSER bursting open with an operatic “laaaaaa!” Belle shrieks and steps back. LUMIÈRE Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer. When she can stay awake. Cogsworth! A diva needs her beauty rrr- 33. MADAME DE GARDEROBE yawns loudly. LUMIÈRE Ah, stay with us, Madame! We have someone for you to dress! Garderobe’s gilded arms stroke Belle’s shoulder and face. Finally. A woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess. But I’m not a princess. Nonsense! Now, let’s see what I’ve got in my drawers. Garderobe’s doors open and a few moths fly out. Oh, how embarrassing. Garderobe places a large HOOP over Belle’s head, and proceeds to create an outfit using fabric and her pinking-shear hands. FROUFROU, a piano stool, runs in, barking like a dog. Come here, Froufrou. Come help mama! Froufrou tugs at the fabric, helping Garderobe complete the outfit -- which is garish and too too much, all wrong for Belle. Perfetta! Lumière and Cogsworth put on a game smile. LUMIÈRE Mm. Subtle. Understated. I love it! With a deep bow and a whistle for Froufrou, Lumière drags Cogsworth out. Plumette and Froufrou follow. Garderobe calls out after her beloved dog. Froufrou, send my love to the maestro! 34. The door closes. Belle is alone. Garderobe instantly falls asleep with a big SNORE. Belle has one beat of... where the hell am I? She ducks down, then crawls out from underneath the enormous dress, which remains standing. She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. She looks down at the 100 foot drop leading to the grounds. Belle turns back to the room, and gazes at the dress. An idea taking shape.

Scene Name: INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT4848
Scene Action: Amidst the animal heads, antlers, and drunken villagers, there is an even sadder sight -- GASTON. He drowns his sorrows in ale while LEFOU listens. Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? “I will never marry you, Gaston.” You know, there are other girls. The village lasses perk up. “Yes! There are other girls!” A great hunter doesn’t waste his time on rabbits. The lasses deflate. “Awww!” LeFou decides it’s time to cheer up his best friend/boss. Thus begins “GASTON.” 35. Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here’d love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There’s no man in town as admired as you You’re everyone’s fa-vor-ite guy Everyone’s awed and inspired by you And it’s not very hard to see why LeFou gives a nod (and a large tip) to the FIDDLE PLAYER in the corner, who nods back, and begins to play... No one’s slick as Gaston No one’s quick as Gaston No one’s neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there’s no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they’ll tell you whose team they prefer to be on! LeFou hops onto the bar, squeezing himself between TOM, DICK, and STANLEY. TOM/DICK/STANLEY Who plays darts like Gaston? Who breaks hearts like Gaston? Who’s much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston? (confidence growing) As a specimen, yes, I’m intimidating LeFou hails a BARMAID and buys everyone a round of drinks. The villagers raise their mugs and cheer. LEFOU/VILLAGERS My what a guy, that Gaston! Gaston stands, and clasps LeFou in gratitude... I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou Well, there’s no one as easy to bolster as you! 36. ... only to find himself in an uncomfortably tight hug. Too much? Yep. No one fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston! In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston! LeFou moves his shirt up his arm to show an old wrestling wound - a nice teeth impression courtesy of Gaston. The villagers gasp. When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver And beasts of the field say a prayer First I carefully aim for the liver Then I shoot from behind! Gaston leaps onto the bar, and is handed a huge blunderbuss, with which he mimes shooting LeFou. Is that fair? I don’t care And Gaston fires the rifle into the ceiling! Plaster rains down. No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston I’M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT EXPECTORATING! Then, he moves around the inn, holding court. 37. Ten points for Gaston! When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Ev’ry morning to help me get large On one shoulder, Gaston lifts a pretty VILLAGE GIRL. On the other, he lifts LeFou. And now that I’m grown I eat five dozen eggs So I’m roughly the size of a barge! The crowd hollers. Gaston jumps on a long table. The table’s height plus his massive frame make him seem 10 feet tall. He engages in a dance-break sword-fight with several VILLAGE MEN, besting them all, until he’s perfectly positioned raised, victorious in battle -- with LeFou swooning at his feet. Who has brains like Gaston? Entertains like Gaston? Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston? Gaston tromps on the table. He arrives at his WALL OF ANIMAL HEADS and ANTLERS. I use antlers in all of my decorating! Say it again - who’s a man among men? And let’s say it once more Who’s that hero next door? Who’s a super success? Don’t you know? Can’t you guess? Ask his fans and his five hangers-on There’s just one guy in town Who’s got all of it down... 38. And his name’s ‘G-A-S-T... ’ Uh, I believe there’s another ‘T’ in there, it just occurred to me that I’m illiterate and I’ve never actually had to spell it out loud before... Gaston! The villagers cheer as Gaston returns to his seat. Gaston slaps LeFou on the shoulder, genuinely moved. Ah LeFou, you’re the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet? I’ve been told I’m clingy, but I really don’t get it... Just then, the door flies open to reveal a wild-eyed Maurice. Help! Somebody help me! We have to go... not a minute to lose... Whoa. Slow down, Maurice. He’s got Belle... locked in a dungeon! Who’s got her? A beast... a horrible monstrous beast! The patrons begin to laugh. My daughter’s life is in danger, why do you laugh!? His castle is hidden in the woods. It’s already winter there! Winter in June? Crazy old Maurice. 39. The beast is real! Do you understand?! Will no one help me?! (ever the opportunist) I’ll help you, Maurice! You will? The villagers murmur in surprise. (winks at LeFou) Everyone! Stop making fun of this man at once! Maurice approaches. So grateful. Thank you, Captain. Thank you. Don’t thank me, Maurice. Lead us to the beast. Maurice exits. Gaston follows, gesturing to LeFou. (finally getting it) Ohhh.

Cornered by the beast, Cogsworth has no choice but to... No no, he gave her a bedroom. LUMIÈRE That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. (turns to Cogsworth) Good thinking, Cogsworth! What?! That’s the most ridiculous idea I’ve ever heard! “Charm the prisoner.” LUMIÈRE You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human. She’s the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? Oh, you can’t judge people by who their father is, now can you? It’s a loaded statement. The staff cringes, ready for his retaliation. Instead, a grunt, and then --

But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. (turns to Cogsworth) Good thinking, Cogsworth! What?! That’s the most ridiculous idea I’ve ever heard! “Charm the prisoner.” LUMIÈRE You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human. She’s the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? Oh, you can’t judge people by who their father is, now can you? It’s a loaded statement. The staff cringes, ready for his retaliation. Instead, a grunt, and then --

The beast’s temper rises -- his eyebrows twitch, his tail thrashes -- recognizing the signs, Plumette inches away -- He’s losing it... The beast beats his fist on the door -- WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! I told you to come down to dinner. Belle hits back. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! And I told you no! All the banging finally wakes up Madame de Garderobe. WHAT!? WHAT TIME IS IT!? I’d starve before I ever ate with you! Well be my guest! Go ahead and starve! (as he leaves) If she doesn’t eat with me, then she doesn’t eat at all! The staff hides, terrified, as the beast thunders off. 44. Idiots! Once the coast is clear, Cogsworth comes out of hiding with a sword and puts on a show of bravery. You can’t talk to us like that! I forbid it! I... I... (to Lumière) Am I too late? Shame. I was really going to tell him off this time. LUMIÈRE (looks past Cogsworth) Oh master, you’ve returned!

Scene Action: Fuming, the beast returns to his lair -- a chamber of shredded furniture and walls ruined in rage. He paces, muttering. He grabs a decaying HAND MIRROR. Show me the girl. The mirror lights up and gives him a view of Belle at the bedroom door. She turns, slides down the wall, and curls her knees up to her. A look of dread on her face. Her fear crushes the beast. The mirror magic fades, and he is left with his own reflection and self-loathing. He lowers the mirror to reveal the glass jar by the open window. In the jar, the ENCHANTED ROSE hangs in mid-air. The rose is wilting. Most of its petals have fallen. Rage evaporating, replaced by shame, the beast lowers his head... ... as ONE MORE PETAL DROPS. The image moves inside the jar. We see the beast through the glass as he leans down, peering in at the petal as it reaches the bottom and shrivels. As it does, we hear a far off RUMBLE, as if the foundation of the castle is trembling. 45.

It’s a very long journey. Let me fix you up before you go. I have found that most troubles seem less troubling after a bracing cup o’ tea. The tea is poured into Chip, who wheels over to Belle. Slowly now, Chip. Belle picks up Chip and brings him up to her mouth. Little Chip finds himself face-to-face with the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. She takes a sip. Pleased to meet you! Want to see me do a trick? Chip blows a huge bubble in his tea cup. It pops loudly. Chip. (to Belle) That was a very brave thing you did for your father, dear. Madame Garderobe’s doors swing open. Yes. We all think so. 47. I’m so worried about him. He’s never been on his own. Cheer up, my poppet. Things will turn out in the end. You’ll feel a lot better after dinner. But he said, “If she doesn’t eat with me, she doesn’t eat at all.” People say a lot of things in anger. It is our choice whether or not to listen. Coming? And Mrs. Potts is out the door.

No, you don’t! If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her, he will blame me. Lumiere jumps up onto the sink, navigating sudsy dishes as CHAPEAU scrubs them. LUMIÈRE Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can’t fall in love if she stays in her room. (looks at a smudged dish) Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot! Lumière tosses the dish back in the sink, skipping onto a passing tea trolley. Cogsworth climbs up in pursuit. 48. You know she will never love him. LUMIÈRE A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times. Lumière leaps onto the table, and uprights a champagne glass. LUMIÈRE Stand up straight! (to the room) It’s time to sparkle! He leaps again, onto CUISINIÈR, and sips a spoonful from a bubbling pot. LUMIÈRE I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite. CUISINIÈR Off! Off me while I work! Pepper, get cracking! Salt, shake a leg! Not so loud! Keep it down! LUMIÈRE Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music? Music?!

Scene Name: INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER6262
Scene Action: To Cogsworth’s horror, Lumière guides an ambulatory HARPSICHORD into the room. This is CADENZA, our neurotic Italian maestro. LUMIÈRE Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? (coy) It has been so long since I’ve performed! I can barely even remember how... But with an abrupt flourish, Cadenza plays show-offy scales on the ivories until -- PLUNK. 49. Another cavity. LUMIÈRE Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She’s counting on you to help us break this curse. Then, I shall play through the dental pain! (whispers to Cadenza) But Maestro. Play quietly. Please. Quietly? Sotto voce? Of course. Are there any other tasteless demands you wish to make upon my artistry? No, that’s it. Mrs. Potts leads Belle to the end of the long dining table. There you are, dear. Lumière LEAPS onto the table. Floating at a high window, Plummette uses a silver platter to turn a shaft of moonlight into a SPOTLIGHT. As Lumière begins “BE OUR GUEST.” LUMIÈRE Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax. Belle sits down in a chair, which moves in, bringing her closer to the table. Lumière motions up to Plumette to steady her shaky spotlight. LUMIÈRE Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents... Cadenza plays a dramatic scale as a table cloth UNFURLS, and Lumière jumps up and LANDS in a pose. Cadenza ends his scale on the wrong note. Lumière shoots him a look, Cadenza plays the right note, and Lumière turns to Belle and smiles. LUMIÈRE 50. ... your dinner. (sings to Belle) Be our guest, be our guest The napkins on the place settings rise up and twirl. Chapeau offers Belle a napkin. LUMIÈRE Put our service to the test Tie your napkin ‘round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest! LUMIÈRE Soup du jour, hot hors d’oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it’s delicious Belle reaches out to try it, but it’s gone before she can. LUMIÈRE Don’t believe me? Ask the dishes! The hors d’oeuvres plates go off, leaving the dinner dishes to levitate and spin. LUMIÈRE They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France! A small guillotine on the table drops, slicing the baguette. MENUS fly in overhead, buzzing a disgruntled Cogsworth. Belle reaches up and grabs one. LUMIÈRE And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu LUMIÈRE Take a glance and then you’ll Be our guest, be our guest LUMIÈRE AND COGSWORTH Be our guest! Cogsworth shushes Lumière, and Lumière jabs him back. One by LUMIÈRE Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flambé! 51. The fish pie explodes! A piece of cod hits Cogsworth in the face, knocking him over. LUMIÈRE We’ll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret! Flute glasses fill up with champagne and then break into a Bob Fosse homage. Belle grabs a glass, but Lumière snatches it before she sips. LUMIÈRE You’re alone and you’re scared But the banquet’s all prepared! Lumière coaxes the flatware to its feet. LUMIÈRE No one’s gloomy or complaining While the flatware’s entertaining! The flatware hold out a napkin, into which Lumière jumps, like a trampoline. He is launched into the air, swinging between chandeliers a la Cirque du Soleil. LUMIÈRE We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet! Lumière falls and lands back in the middle of the champagne flutes. They rise up around him. LUMIÈRE Come on and lift your glass You’ve won your own free pass To be our guest (to Cogsworth) If you’re stressed, it’s fine dining we suggest. Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest! Cogsworth steps back as Lumière again takes center stage in a Martha Graham inspired solo. LUMIÈRE Life is so unnerving For a servant who’s not serving 52. Belle reaches again for food but is stopped by Lumière’s melodramatic histrionics. He wraps himself in a napkin for the full Martha Graham effect. LUMIÈRE He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon Lumière does a ‘tragic walk’ down the table. Reaching the end, he slides down to the floor on the tablecloth, then gathers it around his neck and continues on. Belle tries to stab a bite as the food moves past her, as if on a conveyer belt. Sliding past her, Cogsworth wobbles. On the floor, snow swirls around Lumière. We pull out to see several “ETTES” flinging salt at him to create the effect. LUMIÈRE Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone Reaching the end of the table, plates dive and spin into neat piles -- LUMIÈRE Too long we’ve been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills -- while Cogsworth lands on Lumière’s lap below. Chapeau scoops them both up and drops them back on the table before Belle. LUMIÈRE Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy Lumière playfully pokes Cogsworth in his pot belly -- then takes a flying leap! LUMIÈRE You walked in, and oops-a-daisie!

Only the eyes survived. Bright blue. Engaging. Resembling the eyes of THE BEAST. She realizes that this is the “prince of a fellow” Mrs. Potts was referring to. Belle leans in to study the painting. A ROYAL FAMILY stands by the castle. The FATHER’s image has been slashed. The QUEEN remains pristine. Kind. Beautiful. 56. Belle moves past a large four-poster bed, its faded coverlet gray with dust, like no one has slept in it for years. On the floor, she sees a makeshift bed made of straw, torn bits of nocturnal carnivore. Belle turns and sees the glow coming from the GLASS JAR by an open window leading to the balcony. Inside the jar -- THE Mesmerized, Belle approaches the rose. She lifts the jar, leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches out to touch the rose. A shadow cuts across Belle’s face. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT!? The beast bears down on Belle, backing her up. She puts down the bell jar. Nothing. DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL! GET OUT! GO! Belle runs. The beast turns and covers the rose, panicked and protective.

ANGLE ON PHILIPPE’S MUDDY HOOFPRINT -- a WOLF’S PAW smashes down over the print -- the wolf howls -- ANGLE ON BELLE -- out of the corner of her eye, she sees SHAPES OF A DOZEN WHITE WOLVES flitting through the trees, closing in on her. Belle forges on -- the wolves are not bothering to hide anymore, they’ve emerged from the trees to take down their prey -- closing in fast -- -- Belle pushes through the undergrowth to find she has reached a FROZEN POND. Philippe doesn’t hesitate. He gallops onto the ice, and across the pond. The sound of ice CRACKING under his hooves is deep and low. And increasing. Philippe’s hooves slide on the ice. The wolves close in. Philippe makes it across the pond onto land. But before Belle can feel any relief -- A WOLF’S JAWS snap at Philippe’s thigh. Then another. The horse bucks wildly -- causing Belle to makes a controlled leap onto a snow bank. She seizes a thick branch and wields it as a club -- as the wolves surround her, jaws slavering -- Belle swings her club as one wolf lunges at her, its bared teeth like razors. She beats it away. She turns to confront another -- it bites the branch clean out of her hands. Belle turns, looks up -- on a rock promontory, the scarred ALPHA WOLF is about to take a diving leap onto her. It jumps, and she flinches -- but just as the wolf is about to makes its horrible landing -- THE BEAST APPEARS -- 59. -- and catches it in mid-air! With supernatural force, the beast hurls the wolf across the frozen pond, howling! All the wolves dive on the beast at once, tearing shreds from his cloak. He strikes at them -- wolves scurry, yelping -- The oversize ALPHA WOLF climbs onto the beast’s back, goes for his neck. The beast slams together the wolves on his arms, dropping them -- then reaches back and seizes the Alpha. WOLF and BEAST snarl inches from each other -- the beast squeezes -- Then hurls the Alpha into a stone ledge -- CRACK -- knocking him out. The remaining pack retreats in panic, their yelps echoing through the trees. TIGHT ON BELLE -- watching as the beast whimpers in pain. His shoulders slump. He collapses in the snow. This is her chance. Belle could run. She looks past Philippe, to the woods -- to freedom. But then turns back, and slowly approaches the wounded beast. Belle covers the beast with her blanket. He stirs. One eye opens. You have to help me... you have to stand... The beast is slumped across Philippe’s saddle.

So why don’t we just turn around go back to Villeneuve? I’m sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner... If you think I’ve made all this up, then why did you offer to help? 61. Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let’s go home. Belle is not at home! She’s with the -- IF YOU SAY BEAST ONE MORE TIME, I WILL FEED YOU TO THE WOLVES!

Widows... Yes, yes, that’s it, that’s it... LeFou’s voice snaps Gaston out of his rage. He puts on that Gaston smile like a Halloween mask. Please, forgive me, old bean. That’s no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it? Future father-in-law...? You will never marry my daughter. A beat. Without a word, Gaston hits Maurice, knocking him out.

So you know Shakespeare? I had an expensive education. Actually, “Romeo and Juliet” is my favorite play. Why is that not a surprise? Sorry? All that heartache and pining and - - (a beastly shudder) There are so many better things to read. Like what? The beast smiles.

As she follows his gaze, we reveal a splendidly desolate landscape. The very thing Belle has just described, now spread out before her. Is there more? Belle smiles, pleased that for a moment at least he’s become But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping me up For still here I be.” Belle meets the beast’s eyes. Both suddenly aware of hidden meanings in the poet's words.

Guinevere and Lancelot. Well actually, King Arthur and the Round Table. Knights, and men, and swords and things... But still... it’s a romance. The beast nods, a bit shyly. All right. I felt like a change. I never thanked you for saving my life. Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. Belle laughs. A quiet charged moment, which ends with the SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the servants in the castle. Belle and the beast can’t help but smile. They know how to have a good time. Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. Me, too. The villagers say that I’m a “funny girl,” but I don’t think they mean it as a compliment. I’m sorry. Your village sounds terrible. 73. Almost as lonely as your castle. He turns to her with a melancholy smile. Then, an idea. What do you say we run away? Belle is surprised by the suggestion.

Another little “gift” from the Enchantress... The beast cracks open the book to reveal AN ANTIQUE WORLD ATLAS. No countries. Just land and sea. A book that truly allows you to escape. Belle moves closer to find the pen and ink drawing is alive. Waves lap the beaches. Green trees sway in invisible wind. How amazing. It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you. The beast offers his hand and Belle takes it. He gently moves her hand to the book. Think of the place you’ve most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind’s eye. Now feel it in your heart. Belle nods -- this isn’t a difficult decision. The moment her hand hits the page, we ENTER it, SPINNING through celestial flares -- which blur and recombine -- as the lights of Paris. We descend over the city and into... 74.

The beast watches Belle walk through her childhood home... the artist’s garret that Maurice recreated in his signature music box. Abandoned years ago, the room is crumbling. Belle finds the remains of her father’s easel. A tarnished wall mirror. Her own broken crib. This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived Now I see it’s empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone Belle notices something tucked into a corner of the crib. She pries it loose. It is a BABY’S RATTLE carved into the shape of a rose. The beast focuses on it. What happened to your mother? 75. That’s the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask... As she speaks, the beast notices something on a chair. The dark, pointed mask of a plague doctor. He looks up. Plague. The revelation lands on Belle’s face. She looks around. IN QUICK TIGHT SHOTS --- Belle glimpses what must have happened. A DOCTOR stands in the doorway, his face covered by the mask. You must leave. Now. A bag is hastily packed, Belle’s YOUNGER FATHER (barely seen) taking only what is necessary. He stops to gaze at Belle’s MOTHER, who lies on her deathbed, surrounded by medicines. BELLE’S MOTHER Quickly... before it takes her too... She closes her eyes, turns away. Maurice picks up the baby... who drops her beloved rose- shaped rattle. Belle’s mother touches it to her lips as husband and child disappear. Belle stares at the rattle. I am sorry I ever called your father a thief. Belle lifts her head, her wet eyes look at him. Let’s go home. She means the castle. The beast nods, takes her hand.

Thank heavens. I’ve spent the last five days trying to find you. Suddenly, the villagers shift their gaze to Maurice. No! You tried to kill me! You left me for the wolves! Maurice, it’s one thing to rave about your delusions. It’s another to accuse me of attempted murder. Gaston’s argument lands. The gentle Maurice feels the room slipping away from him. 77. Maurice, do you have any proof of what you’re saying? Ask Agathe! She rescued me! Before Agathe can speak -- Agathe? You’d hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag? (to Agathe) No offense, Agathe. Agathe raises an eyebrow - but says nothing. Monsieur LeFou! He was there. He saw it all. Me? You’re right. Don’t take my word for it. He puts his arm around LeFou and pulls him close. LeFou, my dearest companion, did I, your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot, try to kill the father of the only woman I’ve ever loved? All eyes turn to LeFou, who is clearly torn. It’s a complicated question on a number of accounts, but... no. No, he did not. The crowd reacts. Maurice is crestfallen. Gaston has won. Maurice lunges at Gaston -- who catches his flying fist, easily subduing him. Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you’ve become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind. 78. Gaston signals to Tom, Dick, and Stanley -- and Maurice turns to see them block the exit. Gaston places his large hand on Maurice’s shoulder -- and squeezes. Maurice winces. Everything’s going to be fine.

Scene Action: Belle and the beast stand together under the stars. I haven’t danced in years. I’d almost forgotten the feeling. Mustering his courage -- It’s foolish, I suppose, for a creature like me to hope that one day he might earn your affection. I don’t know... Really? So you think you could be happy here? Could anyone be happy if they’re not free? She gazes wistfully toward the forest. My father taught me to dance. I used to step on his toes a lot. You must miss him. Very much. (thinks, decides) Would you like to see him?

Belle looks at the beast as she has never done before -- with gratitude and appreciation. She moves to return the mirror. No. Keep it with you. And you’ll always have a way to look back on me.

Lumière and Plumette enter behind Cogsworth, followed by Mrs. Potts. LUMIÈRE Master... how could you do that? I had to. But why? The beast doesn’t answer. Because he loves her. LUMIÈRE Then why are we not human? (angry) Because she doesn’t love him! And now, it’s too late. But she might still come back -- No. I’ve set her free. I’m sorry I couldn’t do the same for all of you. He turns away, unable to face them. Now go. Our time is almost past. The staff retreats. As “EVERMORE” begins, the beast pulls on a dark cape. 85.

SCENE 100:
----------------------------------------
Scene Name: EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - SQUARE - NIGHT102102
Scene Action: A horse-drawn asylum wagon thunders into the square where Maurice is surrounded by taunting villagers. The eerie driver, MONSIEUR D'ARQUE, steps out as Tom, Dick and Stanley throw Maurice into his cage on wheels. Villagers approach the wagon like 18th century rubberneckers. Gaston leans into the wagon. The gathering crowd is just loud enough to mask a private plea to Maurice... Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn’t last a week. Just give me your daughter’s hand, and I’ll set you free. Never. Gaston clenches his jaw and locks the door with a CLANK. Take him away! The wagon begins to move. The rubberneckers watch the wagon until they are silenced by a loud... STOP! Belle’s voice cuts through the crowd. They turn and gape at - - BELLE, DAZZLING, IN HER EVENING GOWN. The crowd parts before her as she dismounts Philippe and moves to the wagon. They whisper as she passes -- “Belle...” “Where did she come from?” “Is that Belle...” “Look at that dress...” Gaston stares, slack-jawed, unable to believe his eyes. We linger on the jealous village lasses, the puzzled Jean, the confused LeFou, the foul-tempered Clothilde, the bewildered Pere Robert, and in the shadows... Agathe. 87. Belle fearlessly strides right in front of the wagon. The horses jump up, startled. Belle runs to the locked door. Belle? I thought I’d lost you! Belle sees her father injured on the floor of the wagon. Open this door! He’s hurt! Monsieur d’Arque climbs down to calm her. MONSIEUR D’ARQUE I’m afraid we can’t do that, miss. But we’ll take very good care of him. My father’s not crazy! Gaston... Tell him! Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims. It’s true, Belle. He’s been raving about a beast in a castle. I have just come from the castle and there is a beast! We all admire your devotion to your father, but you’d say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof. Belle pulls out the magic mirror from her sash. You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST! In the mirror, the beast sits slumped against a turret wall. The villagers gasp. Gaston’s face registers shock. There is your proof! 88. This is sorcery! Gaston snatches the mirror from Belle and holds it up to the villagers. Look at this beast. Look at his fangs, his claws. The villagers recoil in fright. No, don’t be afraid. He is gentle and kind. The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn’t know better, I’d say she even cared for him. He’s not a monster, Gaston. You are. (appeals to everyone) The beast would never hurt anyone. I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence! Raucous cries of “Gaston Gaston Gaston!” rise. Gaston holds the mirror up. (to the thugs) We can’t have her running off to warn the beast. Lock her up too. Tom, Dick and Stanley strong-arm Belle into the wagon with her father. This isn’t over Gaston, you’ll see! Gaston, with all due respect -- DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? Fetch my horse. 89. Gaston hops onto the back of the wagon and addresses the crowd. The “MOB SONG” begins as we move through the frightened villagers -- That creature will curse us all if we don’t stop him! Well, I say we KILL THE BEAST! We’re not safe until he’s dead He’ll come stalking us at night Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite! He’ll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free! So it’s time to take some action, boys It’s time to follow me! Gaston grabs a TORCH from a villager and tosses it into a barrel of pitch. Flames rise to the sky. Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It’s a nightmare but it’s one exciting ride Gaston lights Clothilde’s torch, then clasps the shoulder of Monsieur d’Arque, who watches helplessly as his asylum wagon horses are commandeered by the mob. Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It’s a beast, he’s got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we’re not coming home ‘Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST! 90. Some villagers seize shovels, pitchforks, axes. Some light torches in the pitch. Others wrench a boar’s head PIKE STAFF from outside the country inn. Pere Robert tries to calm the frenzy but the force of the mob pushes him back. Light your torch, mount your horse! Screw your courage to the sticking place We’re counting on Gaston to lead the way

They look through the glass, distorted with frost, as the mob moves through the garden. Lumière warms the windowpane with his flame to see more clearly. LUMIÈRE Sacrebleu! Invaders. Ruffians!

Of course I could try to pick the lock. After all, it’s only gears and springs.

Scene Name: INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT115115
Scene Action: It’s EMPTY. Met by eerie silence, Gaston and the mob cautiously enter. The door barely hangs on its hinges. Villagers hold up torches. The flickering light reveals FURNITURE. Chairs. A coat rack. A feather duster. A candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord. Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted? Don’t lose your nerve, LeFou. Gaston looks into the mirror. ANGLE ON LeFou -- he notices Mrs. Potts. Brings his torch close to study her. ANGLE ON THE MOB -- among them, Jean the potter stares at the eerie castle foyer -- This place seems familiar... like I’ve been here before... Gaston approaches the west wing stairs. LeFou brings his face down to the tea pot and teacup. You must be the talking teacup. And you must be his grandmother. Mrs. Potts’ EYES open. Furious. Grand-mother? ATTACK! LeFou jumps back.

Chairs. A coat rack. A feather duster. A candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord. Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted? Don’t lose your nerve, LeFou. Gaston looks into the mirror. ANGLE ON LeFou -- he notices Mrs. Potts. Brings his torch close to study her. ANGLE ON THE MOB -- among them, Jean the potter stares at the eerie castle foyer -- This place seems familiar... like I’ve been here before... Gaston approaches the west wing stairs. LeFou brings his face down to the tea pot and teacup. You must be the talking teacup. And you must be his grandmother. Mrs. Potts’ EYES open. Furious. Grand-mother? ATTACK! LeFou jumps back.

She looks down -- seeing Jean the potter -- and gasps. Mister Potts?! Suddenly, Mrs. Potts slips and drops down towards the floor. Jean the potter looks on in confusion. Chip looks on in terror. Mama! But just as she’s about to shatter, she is caught by a pair of human hands. Mrs. Potts gazes up at -- LEFOU, who seems as surprised as she does. Oh! Thank you. 99. Suddenly, two villagers charge at LeFou from either side. LeFou ducks, the villagers wallop one another, Mrs. Potts spits hot water in their faces, and LeFou punches one out to finish the job. Nicely handled! Well I used to be on Gaston’s side, but we’re in a bad place right now. You’re too good for him anyway... LeFou nods, emotional. Shall we get back to it, then?! Below, Cadenza bucks and rages against villagers, besting them repeatedly as he plays elaborate trills. Such sweet music! Ha ha, I’ll play you like a concerto! Clothilde watches this, and seethes. (points to Cadenza) Silence that harpsichord! Clothilde’s cry rallies a group of villagers, who raise their axes to turn maestro Cadenza into firewood. Maestro! Cadenza looks up to see her. Darling! At last! (shock becomes rage) I’m coming, my love! That’s it! The fat lady is singing! Garderobe belts out a deafening high note and throws her massive girth off the balcony, sending Clothilde and the villagers below scattering. She lands with a graceful THUD. 100. Bravissima! Before the villagers can retaliate, Cadenza’s “teeth” shoot out of his mouth like machine gun rounds. BAM BAM BAM! Lumière runs around with gunpowder trail, creating a line of firecracker explosions that send villagers scattering. LUMIÈRE Watch your toes! In the chaos, we find Agathe, moving quietly through the villagers and up the stairs. What is she up to? As villagers pour out the doors, Lumière and Cogsworth meet at the base of the stairs.

Scene Action: With no hope left, the beast turns away from Gaston, whose finger tightens on the trigger. Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she’d want you? 101. He fires. The beast drops over the edge. On the turret below, his claws make contact with the slanted rooftop and break his fall. He hugs the rooftop, heaving. Gaston looks down over the edge of the turret. He pulls his crossbow and reaches back over his shoulder to draw an arrow from his quiver -- but there’s nothing there. Gaston spins to see Belle, and his arrows gripped in her hands. Belle? Where is he?! With that, Belle snaps Gaston’s arrows over her knee, and tosses them away. Gaston grabs her arm. When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall! She pulls away -- and uses this pivot to grab the barrel of Gaston's pistol. They struggle. With Gaston on the back foot for a split second, Belle yanks the pistol hard. Gaston, not letting go, swings with it, and seeking balance on a loose stone, he drops off the side of the turret! Gaston's reflexes are quick. He lets go of the pistol, grabbing a gargoyle and swinging himself down through a window of the turret. He lands on the spiral staircase. Gaston's pistol, in the meantime, clatters down, coming to rest on the landing of a stone footbridge below.

Scene Action: Wounded, the beast climbs around the lower turret. All around him, turrets quaver and crack. The castle is imploding. I’m coming for you, beast! 102. Gaston continues down until he reaches the bottom of the spiral staircase. He drops to a window box below, and jumps sideways onto another. The beast makes a second leap, onto another parapet. Tiles slide away beneath him as he scrambles to hang on. Belle reaches the landing at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and leaps down onto another adjacent landing. She looks out, trying to see the beast through the turrets. The beast swings around a third parapet and leaps onto another. He's now as far as he can get from Gaston. Finally, Belle reaches a point where she can see the beast on the faraway turret. She screams out as his grip slips. NO! The beast's head turns. Belle? And he spots her. (roars) BELLE! You came back! I tried to stop them! Stay there! I’m coming! Gaston drops onto the walkway lined with gargoyles, landing directly between the beast and Belle. He sneers -- the upper hand is still his. His eyes search for a weapon... he grabs a stone spire, and breaks it off. With superhuman agility, the beast makes a giant leap from the far parapet back toward the central turrets. Back toward Belle. Belle descends the stairs, finally reaching the beast's lair. The beast lands on the gargoyle walk and Gaston jumps out, bringing his club cracking down on the beast's back. The beast roars in pain. But he pushes past Gaston. 103. With Gaston landing blow after blow on the beast's back, the beast staggers down a set of stairs onto the landing of a stone footbridge (where Gaston’s pistol came to rest earlier). Stop! Gaston, no! Belle watches the beast lumbering across the footbridge -- which crumbles under each mighty footfall. The beast reaches the cupola on the far side, directly parallel to the lair. One giant leap stands between him and Belle... Gaston lifts the club to deliver the death blow -- when the beast snatches it. He yanks the club away and hurls it against a far wall. With a snarl, the beast's paw is around Gaston's throat. He lifts Gaston and swings him out over the edge of the landing. (snivelling) No. Don’t let me go. Please. Don’t hurt me, beast. I’ll do anything. TIGHT ON THE BEAST -- his features twisted with rage and hate -- but he controls himself -- and his anger fades. He sets Gaston down. Go. Get out. Gaston scrambles to his feet, and the beast lunges, chasing him away down the outer staircase of the cupola.

His hind claws dig into the stone. And then he's off, gaining speed as he runs on all legs. Belle gasps -- and the beast leaps. He's airborne, flying over the chasm -- and he just makes it to the balcony -- landing on all fours! He rises, and smiles. BOOM! The beast roars in agony. Past him, across the chasm, Belle spots Gaston on the crumbling walkway, pistol back in hand. He grins as he reloads for the kill shot -- and as Belle watches, helpless, he takes aim again -- and fires. The beast drops -- just as the walkway beneath Gaston collapses. In an instant, there's nothing beneath his feet, and he disappears, screaming, in a cascade of stones. Belle cradles the beast’s head. Anguished. He lies there, breathing heavily. Softly, the beast rests his paw on Belle’s hand. Fading, his eyes look at her with perfect love. You came back. Of course I came back. I’ll never leave you again. I’m afraid it’s my turn to leave. We’re together now. It’s going to be fine. You’ll see. At least I got to see you one last time. The paw drops as the beast dies in her arms. No... please, no...

Scene Name: EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAWN132132
Scene Action: As the light passes over, an upside-down FROUFROU transforms back into a tiny BICHON FRISE basking in the sun. He leaps up and chases his tail (still a tassle), then trots over to CHAPEAU and relieves himself on his leg -- which changes into a human foot. Chapeau transforms back into a VALET and shoos the dog away with his walking stick. As the dog weaves through his legs, the valet loses his balance and bumps into the trolley cart holding Mrs. Potts and Chip. It starts to roll toward the stairs. The valet backs into Garderobe, who waddles in and out of sunlight, changing from wardrobe to human to wardrobe again. Cadenza’s face comes alive as he sees the wardrobe falling onto him. As it crashes, the wardrobe’s doors fly open, sending out a flurry of garments. We follow them back to the ground, where the human DIVA now lies on top of the human Oh, Madame. Oh, Maestro. The maestro smiles his now-toothless grin. She tearfully embraces him -- as their dog joins in. The trolley rolls past, taking us to Cogsworth, whose back is bathed in sunlight. We move around to reveal the pudgy MAJORDOMO, human except for his moustache, which still resembles the hands of a clock. He peers through his monocle, sees -- The French FOOTMAN (formerly Lumière) come into view. 108. Lumière! LUMIÈRE Cogsworth, we beat the clock! Mon ami. They greet each other as a feather floats by, brushing the footman’s nose. They look over to see -- A pile of feathers... from which the footman pulls the sexiest French MAID in history, her feathers blossoming into a dress around her. LUMIÈRE Plumette... mon amour... And then, the greatest kiss ever. Their passion ignites a tiny flame on the footman’s head, which the maid pats out. They turn as they hear -- The trolley SQUEAKING as it nears the steps, about to crash down. Mrs. Potts and Chip rattle on a tray, which suddenly jerks to a stop on the precipice. The valet has hooked the cart with his walking stick, but... Mrs. Potts and Chip slide down the incline... shoot off the tray... and start to TRANSFORM IN MID-AIR! They sled to the bottom of the steps and skid to a halt, fully human again. CHIP hugs his MOTHER... he finally got her to skate! Oh, Chip! What did I tell you? Look at you -- you’re a little boy again! Oh you smell so good! From the castle grounds, astonished villagers approach, blinking, as the veil is lifted from their memory. Darling!? Mr. Potts! Beatrice! Chip! I remember! I do! They embrace -- a family reunited.
