# PDF Text Extraction Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
The system is storing `"PDF file: BLACK_PANTHER.pdf"` instead of extracted text, indicating PDF text extraction is failing.

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
When you upload a PDF, look for these logs:
```
📦 PDF.js worker configured for version: 5.3.93
🧪 Testing PDF.js worker initialization...
📍 Worker source: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/5.3.93/pdf.worker.min.js
✅ PDF.js worker test passed (or ❌ PDF.js worker test failed)
```

### 2. File Upload Process
When uploading BLACK_PANTHER.pdf, you should see:
```
📁 Processing file: BLACK_PANTHER.pdf (application/pdf)
📄 Starting PDF text extraction for: BLACK_PANTHER.pdf
📦 File size: X.XX MB
🔧 PDF.js version: 5.3.93
👷 Worker URL: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/5.3.93/pdf.worker.min.js
✅ File loaded as ArrayBuffer: XXXXX bytes
📚 PDF loaded. Pages: XX
📖 Extracted page 1: XXXX characters
...
✅ PDF text extraction completed. Total characters: XXXXX
```

### 3. Common Error Messages to Look For

**Worker Issues:**
```
❌ PDF.js worker test failed: Error loading worker
❌ PDF processing failed: Worker script could not be loaded
```
**Solution:** Check internet connection, worker URL accessibility

**Invalid PDF:**
```
❌ Invalid PDF file: The file appears to be corrupted
❌ Error extracting PDF text: InvalidPDFException
```
**Solution:** Try a different PDF file, ensure PDF is not corrupted

**Permission Issues:**
```
❌ Error extracting PDF text: UnexpectedResponseException
```
**Solution:** Check CORS policies, file permissions

## Manual Test Steps

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Upload your BLACK_PANTHER.pdf file**
4. **Look for the debug messages above**
5. **If you see errors, copy them and check the solutions**

## Alternative Solutions

If PDF.js continues to fail, we can implement:
1. **Server-side PDF processing** (requires backend)
2. **Alternative PDF library** (pdf-parse, etc.)
3. **Manual text input** as fallback

## Test Files
Try these test cases:
- Small PDF (< 1MB)
- Text-only PDF (no images/scans)
- Simple script format PDF

The detailed console logs will help identify the exact failure point!
